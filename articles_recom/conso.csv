"""We need to take the necessary steps, or else it will be too late"", said Ryan to his team in a stern voice. He was the IT head of a leading bank in North America. Ryan was worried about the significant gap concerning the multiple CAPs (Corrective action plans) addressing an OCC (Office of the Comptroller of the Currency) and MRA (Matters Requiring Attention) commitment to automate the Return Mail (un-delivered / forwarded mails) function. The reason was that the OCC review had determined that their existing process and controls were inadequate to ensure the retention of customer consent.

These return mails were mainly related to the sales practice artefacts, monthly customer statements, bank letters along with the physical customer cards(credit). To ascertain better customer consent and to standardise the processing across LOB's, Rayan knew that he required a new, improved system. TCS had been the bank's long-standing partner managing various critical projects. They agreed to meet the aggressive timeline to satisfy CAP requirements and develop the complex system within the given scope. Hence, Ryan assigned the projects to TCS.

At the start, the TCS team performed a detailed analysis of the requirements. Based on this information, they realised that the main challenges were an aggressive timeline, coordinating with thirty different teams across the client system and occurrences of new scenarios which in turn impacting the process flow several times. So, they roped in Pritam Ghosh as a contextual master to drive the project. This is because he had previously worked with the client and had gained in-depth knowledge of their business and IT landscape. Besides, he had a strong domain knowledge and was completely aware of the OCC regulations. With the help of this acquired contextual knowledge, Ryan was able to implement a robust, actionable solution.






Pritam communicated with the various stakeholders to understand their requirements. Later, he passed this information to the offshore developers to build up the system. Pritam carried out the groundwork to first understand the issues faced due to inadequate handling of returned mails. Then contributed to the analysis and design approach to implement the solution. This included building completely new processes. As per the need of learning new technologies, he conducted training sessions for the same. Pritam maintained the work balance by adequately distributing the sub-modules as per the overall team strength and monitored the progress status strictly for on-time delivery.

Post-implementation, the client was happy with the solution because it standardised the processes for handling return mails. Also, there was proper tracking of returned mails and analysing the feed from their mailing partner. The solution identified issues related to undelivered addresses where the mailing partner could not deliver the physical mails. As a result, the returned mail volume reduced significantly. The client congratulated Pritam and the TCS team through various forums. For TCS, this solution strengthened the relationship and enabled future opportunities.",The Journey Of Automation Of Return Mail Function,"MRJ, Mr. SABAREESH KUMAR (SABAREESH KUMAR)",Cards,Legacy Transformation,Cost & Optimization,Item,1
"*Kenneth, the VP (IT operations) of a leading bank with a big presence all over the world, was huddled in a meeting with other IT heads of the organization. Together, they were evaluating an idea to move to the agile methodology to leverage faster time-to-market of its products and to reduce the overall cost of licensing of expensive tools and software. Based on existing market trends and the company's current operations, it was decided to use a behavior-driven development (BDD) framework for in-sprint automation.

It was also decided to outsource this project to TCS because of the strategic partnership that both these companies shared. Manoj Kumar Mohanty was assigned to this project as he had been working with the client for the last 13 years and knew the client's business and IT landscape well. Manoj had worked across various digital channels of this client and had vast experience in the browser, mobile, and ATM front-end applications. He understood the applications and their nuances extremely well, including the functional, regression use cases, and test cases. This understanding, along with the in-depth knowledge of the prevalent automation framework and tools, made him the perfect fit to carry out this transformation.

Manoj identified two things that needed to be addressed; one was to identify the right tools that would enable a cost-effective BDD automation, and the second was to transform the TCS team of QAs in a manner that would aid the client realize its goal of in-sprint automation. Manoj began with the PoCs of BDD automation for small applications in different markets and explored the availability of open-source frameworks that would give uniformity in design and coding across the three channels (Browser, iOS, and Android). Based on this assessment, he and his team customized the framework to suit the customer’s application.


It was decided to use Cucumber, Selenium and Appium as automation tools, Bitbucket for code check-in, and Jenkins for triggering the automation jobs. However, the key was the framework that needed multiple library-based designs to help scrum teams to adopt BDD, with very minimal coding for their features. A basic framework was created by Manoj and his team and it evolved after many rounds of customer/user feedback. In parallel, Manoj trained the QAs and upskilled them to handle BDD automation. It took about six months for the entire process to fall in place, and the customer was very happy with the results as it helped to save money on licensing, as well as execute 60% of the regression test suite within the first five days of the month. Besides, Manoj managed to upskill 70% of QAs, and together, they were able to perform well in BDD automation.

Overall, it was a challenging transformation and Manoj's perseverance, contextual knowledge, automation experience, and efforts made it a success story for TCS.",Achieving Insprint Automation With Behaviordriven Development,"M, Mr. KARTHEKEYAN (Karthekeyan)",Retail Banking,Agile Transformation,Cost & Optimization,Item,1
"57 per associate per day.

The manager of the unit, Celestino Vaz, rose to the occasion. Celestino, who had been working with the client for the last 13 years, was deeply familiar with their operations processes. He was aware that the card process was extremely dynamic with staggered shift (23/7) windows and week offs. He knew that along with managing availability and taking care of coverage throughout the working window, the unit also had stringent KPIs to score on. He took up the challenge of ensuring a smooth transition to SBWS to maintain continuity in the client’s processes.






Celestino followed a phased approach for Desktop movement, classifying deliveries according to location. He assigned SPoCS to keep in touch with the Admin and Security teams to complete deliveries on time. Associates from the unit were deployed, independent of the Admin team, to complete packaging and shipping of Desktops from TCS campuses in Mumbai. Celestino and the unit’s Operations Manager personally delivered some items such as headsets and other peripherals. Celestino also nominated SPoCS to track Desktop deliveries and trigger VPN requests, on a priority basis. NDA signoffs were completed in phases to avoid gaps between systems received vs. gone live. Celestino used FortiClient and MPASS+ to deploy SBWS, including inward and outward tracker to track system movement till delivery stage.

The transition to SBWS enabled revenue generation for TCS after a gap of 45 days, as the team had stopped working from office, effective May 20, due to lockdown. The new work setup enabled strong calling lines for clients (new broadband connections) as compared to thin and negative lines that were forecast for 45 days when the site was not operational. Enablement of more FTEs led to efficient management of larger call volumes during the COVID-19 lockdown for the Client. TCS went live with more than 90% FTEs right from the first month of initiating SBWS. This reduced wait time on the automated system for end customers. More FTE deployment also resulted in less abandoned volumes.

The client greatly appreciated Celestino’s leadership during challenging times. By leading from the front, Celestino facilitated his unit’s transition to SBWS in record time even though it had seemed impossible only a month ago.",Smooth Transition To Secure Borderless Workspaces In Record Time During Covid19 Lockdown,N.

"A first in industry product deserves grand marketing campaigns across all channels. A lot rides on it. When the introduction of the market to the world does not go well, chances are, neither will the sales.

The same was the case with the client - a leading global financial institution headquartered in the USA. The product vendor issued a last-minute mandatory vulnerability patch.

The solution was to dismantle LOB basis executions and operate as “end customer journey” basis organisation. This transformation was not simple, as it required the complete revamping of client’s huge organisation structure and their ‘way of working’.

The result saw an increase in team collaboration and reuse of best practices and building common solutions. The result saw a reduction in technology overhead and workforce by 15%. Soon, this transformation approach was being implemented in other regions of a client like LATAM & APAC. This also helped reduce their technology overhead with respect to the total cost of ownership, outdated tech stack and skillset availability.

"A leading US-based bank with branches across the globe was facing a critical problem – the time to market was really slow and it took a good 9 months for the process to see the light of the day from the ideation period to the implementation. This was resulting in loss of market share and the business was down by almost 40 percent compared to previous years. Martin, the CTO of the company took charge of the situation and decided to implement the Agile-Scrum methodology in their development processes, to improve the situation.

But implementing it was no easy task since the bank had over 50 million customers and used 3rd party vendor applications in the home lending space. And it was a big challenge to implement scrum for 35 risk control and compliance applications. But the work had to be done anyway, and so, Martin decided to hire a third-party vendor to get the job done. Martin decided it was better to go with an old and experienced third-party vendor instead of hiring someone new. So, without a second thought, he decided to work with TCS – an old strategic partner of the bank for several years. Martin arranged for a quick meeting with the TCS team and after a thorough discussion, the latter agreed to help immediately.

After understanding the requirements, the TCS team assigned the project to one of their best employees – Rajesh Kumar. Rajesh was an expert in Agile and Scrum processes and the best part was – he was associated with the bank for more than 3 years and had delivered challenging technology for the client. He had a very good knowledge of the client’s business systems and scrum practices, which helped him build a roadmap.






Rajesh was able to chalk out the Agile roadmap for 3 scrum teams for servicing line, which was to be pioneered at an organizational level for the client. Rajesh created a backbone sheet that gave comprehensive visibility of the work to be delivered to all teams. He defined a consistent story point estimation approach to be practiced in 3rd party applications. Rajesh also collaborated with internal risk & control teams and aligned the vendor’s deliverables in line with the customer roadmap.

Rajesh was successful in identifying the vendor-related dependencies and translated into the backbone sheet with accurate story point estimation. He also coached the development teams and business teams on the client’s firm-wide agile practices and sped them up. The practices ensured that all the teams were able to deliver to the same cadence.

The solution worked like a charm and helped to reduce the time to market for new features from 9 months to 3 months. The solution also gave the team a streamlined process to execute the work smoothly with consistent velocity. Everyone including business and technology stakeholders expressed their delight with the results by showering rewards and recognition on Rajesh. As an added benefit, the home loan division managed to close more than 400 technology risk & control related breaks, which was a big achievement. And the successful implementation of the project also resulted in a $1 million revenue for TCS, which was a cherry on the pie.",Leveraging Agile For Risk Compliance Control,SENTHILNATHAN K.S,Retail Banking,Agile Transformation,Growth & Transformation,Item,1
"A leading US-based multinational bank wanted to build a best-in-class Open Banking platform using Fintech to provide a 360-degree view of customer’s accounts and products within a single dashboard – via a third-party application – as a part of its next-gen digital platform. The current BAU/legacy platform required the customer to log into the outdated legacy portal to view their account information and there was no way for the customer to have a 360-degree view of accounts spread across multiple divisions.

Aggregation of all the customer accounts into a single view through partner application required integration with accounts services. But this integration could cause service failures and a resulting reputational loss and other complications. Another concern was the decreased performance; all good reasons for the client to approach TCS to aid them in arriving at an economical and robust solution.
Suresh Palani and his team had gauged the client’s expectations and accordingly performed a PoC integration with the host systems. This way, they not only targeted minimizing the overall performance but also aimed to achieve the end goal without being dependent on other teams.

To this end, Suresh Palani and his team decided to address this challenge with an agile approach. During his four-year stint with the bank, Suresh had gained a thorough understanding of the client’s business processes and application landscape, and armed with this knowledge, he created an agile framework to manage the processes efficiently and iteratively. He identified the dependencies and gaps using his knowledge of the client’s existing platform and accordingly came up with a roadmap to address the same. He prioritized the sprint with development and integration activities and with the help of the development team, service vulnerabilities were enhanced and fixed across all regions.

Suresh also focused on delivering the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) as per the sprint calendar to not only build stakeholders' confidence but also to understand the overall user experience. This way the team’s efforts led to a substantial reduction in Time-to-Market and a significant improvement in the overall user experience.

Besides schedule-setting and coordination, Suresh used his contextual knowledge to design a dashboard for monitoring the critical functional components as a part of the anti-fraud requirements. This aided the testing team to perform end-to-end testing of the anti-fraud modules, while the monitoring dashboard provided the stakeholders with a real-time view of the fraud module.

In all, Suresh's deep contextual knowledge and experience in the financial services industry helped the client to redesign existing processes and reduce the time required for monitoring the antifraud dashboards.

"A leading US-based multinational bank wanted to build a best-in-class Open Banking platform using Fintech to provide a 360-degree view of customer’s accounts and products within a single dashboard – via a third-party application – as a part of its next-gen digital platform. The current BAU/legacy platform required the customer to log into the outdated legacy portal to view their account information and there was no way for the customer to have a 360-degree view of accounts spread across multiple divisions.

Aggregation of all the customer accounts into a single view through partner application required integration with accounts services. But this integration could cause service failures and a resulting reputational loss and other complications. Another concern was the decreased performance; all good reasons for the client to approach TCS to aid them in arriving at an economical and robust solution.

"A leading US-based retail bank wanted to embark on a digital transformation journey to become more customer-centric and enhance user experience. However, the bank’s legacy customer servicing systems were proving to be a roadblock in meeting the needs of tech-savvy digital natives. Disparate systems, inability to port functions to multiple form factors, incompatibility with Application Programming Interface (API) platforms and cloud computing technologies, delays in enabling new features were some of the challenges the bank was grappling with. The client wanted to adopt the cloud-based Salesforce CRM platform and retire the legacy applications, and was looking at TCS, for support in this digital transformation.

Over a decade-old relationship with the client, Milind Agnihotri had developed a deep understanding of the client’s legacy systems, IT architecture, workflows, and dependencies with a clear view of how a change would impact business-as-usual. Milind conducted a comprehensive knowledge transfer to his team on the functional and technical facets of the client ecosystem thereby ensuring they are up to the speed with requisite contextual knowledge. A strong grasp of the as-is system architecture and the intricate know-hows of the system interactions helped him and his team to better understand the requirements and come up with a comprehensive design of the system that would be compatible for digital technology adoption.

Milind’s knowledge of the legacy system ensured that the business logic and rules were accurately replicated in the new solution by the different teams thereby ensuring data integrity in downstream systems. This was critical to avoid business disruption and to ensure required regulatory compliance. Milind and his team enabled the Salesforce Lightning platform on the client’s systems on Nov 5, 2018, well ahead of the 2019 deadline.

The platform now serves over 5,000 users including the bank’s Gold customers across various lines of business such as wealth management, small and medium business, private banking, and retail banking. With this platform, the bank successfully reduced operational complexity and enhanced banker’s ability to service clients. Moreover, the client became future-ready as the new systems are compatible for digital technology adoption. Tablet and mobile capabilities resulted in faster customer service, increased employee productivity and collaboration, and enhanced product knowledge leading to increased engagement. The platform helped the bank gain a 360-degree view of customers paving the way for analytics and business growth.

This is just a beginning for Milind to lead one of TCS’ biggest Salesforce lightening implementations, and more are in the pipeline.",Gearing Up For The Digital Era,SHAROAN Mohammed,Retail Banking,Digital Transformation,Growth & Transformation,Item,1
"A leading global bank had a critical and high visibility function named MIS (Management Information Systems). MIS deals with bulk data that are to be extracted from different sources and applying algorithms to present clear and concise representation using bars, charts, and graphs. These tools were then used to understand the health of projects and identify essential gaps across multiple projects. Since the data was used to make very critical decisions and most of the data were extracted and processed manually, there was a high risk of manual errors. Roberta, the CTO of the company was aware of this and so, she decided to automate the weekly reports that would be used by various stakeholders and the peer review process using Selenium to reduce time and manpower on the review process.

However, this was no mean feat and so, Roberta decided to hire an external vendor to get the work done. After a lot of considerations, Roberta decided to work with TCS – one of the oldest vendors of the company. She arranged for a quick meeting to discuss her needs and TCS was more than glad to extend support. TCS took over the project in May 2017 and handed over the same to Senthil Shiyalam, one of the best employees that the consultancy had in this domain. Senthil had worked on similar projects and so, had the required knowledge. He had also worked with this particular client in the past, which helped him understand the gaps and challenges. He was also a quick and fast learner, which helped him learn about new technologies and processes and implement the same in his work.



Senthil quickly formed a team of his own and his first step was to create VB Macros for all the weekly reports. Using VB scripting, Senthil designed Macros where the team could produce all critical reports required for project managers and senior management. Senthil designed the macros in such a way that all WOR (Weekly Operation Review) decks were automatically generated by VB macros. All peer review could be executed by the selenium scripts within 30-60 mins, which consumed more than 2 PD days through manual review. Senthil’s prior knowledge helped him avoid major blockers during the entire automation process.
The team also handled issues like access restrictions and conflicts between multiple teams with due diligence without impacting the timeline of the project. The project was successfully wrapped up by Senthil and his team and was highly praised by Roberta and her associates. They praised Senthil’s open mindset and gusto to take on challenges and were also highly appreciative of TCS’s capability to come up with innovative ideas to solve problems every time.",Spearheading Automation Project For Banking Client,SENTHIL Shiyalam,Retail Banking,Automation,Cost & Optimization,Item,1
"A leading global bank had climbed its way to success after a lot of hard work and diligence. Currently, it was one of the leading banks with operations all over the globe. And the credit for the same went to all the hard-working employees of the company and the very capable senior management – one of them being Simon, the CTO of the company. Simon was a very capable and talented individual who was the IT chief. The entire IT team looked up to him for suggestions and solutions whenever there was a problem. But off late, the bank had been facing a problem that had got even Simon worried.

Teams had reported that the job count and the application counts were very high and required immediate stabilization. There were several problems like two major servers in a platform, lack of a database version upgrade, need of ETL tool migrations and scheduler migrations, which had increased the job count. The systems were also in dire need of automation. Simon realized that the months ahead would be difficult and that the IT team needed the expertise of a talented external vendor to sort everything and put them back in place. So, to save the company from facing future losses, Simon immediately started to look out for external vendors.



After a few rounds of discussion with colleagues, Simon realized that it would be safe to handover the project to TCS – a consultancy that had over a decade old association with the bank. TCS was happy to help and took over the project, assuring Simon that the team would surely fix their problems with effective and innovative solutions. The team handed over the project to Ivy, a TCS employee for over 10 years. She was back to work after maternity leave and the team believed this was the right project for her to get started.

Besides Ivy’s experience and skills, the fact that made her a perfect fit for project lead was the fact that she had previously worked for the same client, which had helped her gain enough knowledge about the company’s business scenario, customers, etc. Ivy used this knowledge to eventually come up with a solution in the end with her equally capable team. Right from the start, the team held KT sessions to grasp as much knowledge as possible about the systems, applications, and other issues.

Eventually, with the team’s hard work and dedication, they could implement automation at various stages, streamline the teams and reduce the size, and most importantly, help save the company a lot of money and also gain new important customers. They were eventually successful in stabilizing the project, which also earned Ivy's team the prestigious AWE award. Simon appreciated Ivy and her team’s work and was impressed with the way they solved their problems and came up with effective solutions.",Seamless Server Management For Business Expansion,Mohit Goyal,Cards,Application Migration,Growth & Transformation,Item,1
"A leading global bank with a strong presence in Latin America was going through difficult times. Despite doing well on the business front, the IT system was still not up to the mark, which had resulted in quite a few problems. The most recent one was with an old application. The bank was under red alert from the regulators to change the tech stack since it was a very old application and it was not coherent on many parameters set by Mexican Central Monetary Authority. John, the CTO of the company was at the helm of things and still struggling to set things right.

John knew the IT team couldn't fix the problem since they lacked the required domain knowledge. The team was still struggling with the change management process for delivery and unfortunately, this was pushing back the overall progress. However, John was also aware that the company had a deadline to maintain and missing it could draw penalties to the customer and restriction to do business in the particular LOB as well. So, he quickly decided to hire a third-party vendor who could help the team fix these problems. After a lot of searches, John settled with TCS, an old external vendor to the bank.

Although fairly new, TCS had worked on a few small projects for the bank and left a mark for itself during that time. This had earned the consultancy a lot of faith from all quarters, and the current project too. This was the first big project from the bank and so, TCS gladly took it up. This was the perfect opportunity for TCS to show the strength of its global practices and innovative ways of delivering a project and it wouldn’t let it go to waste. The TCS team allotted the project to Shalu Pandey, an old and talented TCS employee. Shalu had worked on similar projects in the past and had the required knowledge and skills to lead the project successfully.

So, without wasting any more time, Shalu dived in to understand the setbacks and problem areas. Once done, Shalu acted as both the scrum master and the agile coach for the project. She started injecting the agile processes and ceremonies that included the working methodology as well as the way of status reporting. She planned the PoC and divided the team into Agile Squads based on different modules of the application. This enabled quicker learning of the app and also resolved domain-related issues. Shalu continuously motivated the team with the “Customer First” approach and the team proactively produced results according to the capacity planning.

Shalu’s solution was a success and it inspired John to adopt this process in various other projects as well. John was so impressed with Shalu’s work that he requested her to provide the best practices and lessons learned during the phase and also share the experience with the other teams in other locations.

"A leading global provider of financial services has been a TCS client since 2005. Among many of the client’s IT services that TCS supports, Quality Assurance is a crucial one. The client had implemented the concept of Global Common Code (GC) and clustered 10 APAC countries as part of this critical initiative. It was looking at ways of improving productivity. A potential issue the client was facing, was the unorganized test repository.




The repository had issues of redundancy, unmanaged volumes of data and no backward referencing – requiring huge effort consumption. Regarded as non-priority, it was overlooked in lieu of covering strategic goals. As a result, the repository expanded to 100K test instances across LOBs, with a high degree of redundancy. It became an inconvenience for the script designers, who spent more time into its rework.

To be agile and responsive to industry demands and for quicker time to market, the client wanted to clean up its script repository, make it highly functional and align its output directly in line with the organizational goals.
Nareshwer Babu had gained in-depth knowledge in development tools, working in various technical languages and domain areas. He had a good grasp of complicated architectures and strategies of the client.

With years of working in the client’s IT environment, Nareshwer knew the testing process the client followed. Since he was involved in the innovation and maintenance activities in close coordination with the stakeholder’s business groups, he knew the functionality of applications, underlying architecture, level of testing required for each functionality, risks associated with each functionality and how test cases can be combined, sequenced or prioritized. Thus, he knew the client’s pain points, where things were getting stuck and what was needed to clean up the repository.

Selectively picking from his vast body of contextual and technical knowledge and experiences, Naresh came up with an intelligent assistant (bot), powered by a Natural Language Processing (NLP) engine that he self-branded as the “T-Assist” tool, built in collaboration with the Enterprise Intelligent Automation team from TCS. Naresh went several steps ahead and developed this user-friendly chatbot to make referencing easier.

Naresh’s efforts yielded great benefits for the client organization. T-Assist is a learning system that extracts features from test-wares in the Application Life Cycle Management systems. It is capable of performing de-duplication with a parameterized degree of matching criteria set by the user. As a bot, it is designed to carry out intelligent conversations supporting omni-channel experiences, it is characterized by interactivity, cognition and predictive capabilities assisting test analysts. The digital tool delivers upto 85% accuracy, reduces test design effort by nearly 10%, eliminates duplication across projects within releases by upto 5%, enables shift-left and yields 15% automation re-use wherever deployed. Together all this has resulted in accommodating 10% more volume in every release, at the organizational level!

The tool was well received by the client Director, who even demonstrated it during one of their technical summits, where the digital tool received maximum recognition amongst other tools presented!

We have continually established ourselves as a player with pioneering moves in the global market – a major reason for our continued relationship with the client. This first of its kind, out-of-the-box solution has encouraged all teams involved to come up with more such innovations.

The T-Assist tool is currently being enhanced to include more features like dynamic prioritization and execution sequencing, considering relevant risk factors the client organization faces.

"A major American bank underwent a massive transformation in technology, process, and system to offer an extraordinary banking experience to its customers. The transformation was highly appreciated by its customers and the bank was celebrating the success of this major revamp. Within a few months, the banking team was in a tough situation as they were receiving disputes on the chargeback. Soon they discovered a glitch in the chargeback process in the newly transformed environment.

Whenever another bank would transact through the client bank’s ATM, the client’s bank had a right to charge a surcharge to the other external banks. However, there was an important clause for the banks to provide their consent before being issued with the surcharge. Now the issue was, the fee was charged for as many as 100K transactions without the consent of other banks and hence qualified for a chargeback. Chargeback being a complex transaction process, would incur a huge cost and time. Moreover, with a large number of transactions in hand, the client understood that it would be a humongous task to execute the reversal.

The bank approached TCS to help them bail out from this critical situation with immense trust. TCS, being one of the leading BFSI back-office service providers in the world, agreed to collaborate and not only to fix the issue but also correct the wronged transactions with a chargeback. Sampath Kumar, a senior professional, highly regarded by the client, was roped into the assignment due to his experience in pulling out stunning results out of tough situations.

As soon as Sampath took over the responsibility, he called for the transformation team to propose an idea. He knew that Automation was the best way to overcome the effects of the glitch in a short span of time. The initial estimation of manually processing the chargeback would take a minimum of 3 months in parallel with their business as usual. Sampath knew exactly that it was a long period and it would affect the client’s business terribly. He described the entire situation to the transformation team developers and insisted on building a bot to automate repetitive manual tasks. He was also particular that the development of the bot would not take more than a week. With thorough dedication and involvement to help the client, the transformation team was ready to showcase the bot to the client under 3 days.

The client was taken by surprise seeing the efforts of Sampath’s leadership and started to see some light through the tunnel. The bot was efficient enough to handle a thousand cases in normal business hours. After deploying the bot in production setup, each associate of the bank could easily fix as many as a thousand transactions per day using the bot. The bot was so helpful that it was named Bot Buddy fondly. The estimated three-month-long activity was completed in a matter of ten days. The client was falling short of words in appreciating TCS’s efforts to save them from a critical situation. The client’s leadership team was thrilled to express the sheer joy of seeing their business back on track.

Sampath, the domain leader for Disputes globally, put to use his contextual knowledge to solve the critical puzzle. He also collaborated with other teams within TCS and leveraged their expertise to provide results in just 10 days instead of the originally estimated 12 weeks. The client was very impressed and went a step ahead to award a cash prize (transformation benefit) to TCS.

"A multinational financial corporation with a large share of the global credit card segment was witnessing a steady decline in reward redemption, and Mike, the Associate Vice President (Marketing), was beginning to feel the heat. Dwindling redemption, he knew, was the harbinger of an eroding customer base.

The reason for the problem, though, was amply visible. The redemption system was a mess. Browsing, choosing, and redeeming the points were a pain. Worse, redemption was restricted, localized, and limited in product choices. This set of problems lowered the perceived value rewards.

The corporation was keen on overhauling the platform, and had specific ideas about it. They wanted a single platform with a common catalog that would service consumers across markets while being mindful of the dollar value differences for rewards. Most important, they wanted a watertight system that would adhere to all data privacy regulations across all markets.

Since TCS was already a trusted partner, and also had the expertise and experience in designing and executing major re-engineering projects in the rewards space, the corporation reached to them for a solution.

Soumya was TCS’s choice for the job. Being a Subject Matter Expert (SME) with 15 years’ experience in the credit card domain, Soumya wasted no time in creating and implementing a plan that covered the client’s demands, and more.

After listing out the common and the country-specific requirements for the platform, Soumya and his team prioritized the items and secured sign-offs from each business. Following a detailed roadmap, the team began migrating a fixed number of countries for each quarter based on the consumer base, redemption volume, and preparation of the business teams for migration.

Soumya’s UI approach ensured efficient migration with minimal developmental effort. The product passed multiple trials with different vendors and dummy users with flying colors.

This was the first-ever universal platform for rewards redemption. No other lender had ever worked on a global platform for redemption. The results were glorious, with live statistics recording a 4.5-fold jump in spending on Rewards card compared to Non-Rewards cards. TCS’ success reflected in client’s topline. The Global Rewards Platform became a runner-up in the APAC annual review in the ‘Best Executed Project’ category.

The client lauded Saumya’s contextual knowledge and expertise in the rewards space and his squad was chosen for the Best Team and the Star Team awards from TCS.",Industryfirst Rewards Platform Revolutionizes Credit Card Landscape,SHAROAN Mohammed,Cards,Production Management,Growth & Transformation,Item,1
"ABC, one of the front-runners of the banking sector in the US, recently moved to Agile framework for its digital portfolio, establishing over 100 scrum teams to manage its deliverables across onsite and offshore locations. ABC had various challenges in securing SDLC release-level artifacts across the multiple scrum teams within the delivery phases, which led to rise in Non-Compliance Issues and Under Reviews by the reviewers during the audit process.

Auditing the SDLC artifacts is the most salient metric for banking companies as they directly affect the CIO scorecards for the bank and ABC’s digital portfolios. PMO groups were heavily burdened with NCI and URI findings, which turned out to be a major concern for ABC to pay immediate attention to, as these process changes were required to bring artifact gaps under control.
TCS, being a long term partner for ABC, were approached to analyze the problem space and provide a feasible solution to improve the CIO scorecard for the client’s digital portfolio. This was when Manoj Kumar, an expert in Agile framework, was best positioned to provide a solution to the issue.



Manoj came up with an SDLC adherence process for the PMO group to adopt, consisting of Agile transformation practices within the digital channels. This resulted in a collaborative effort in chasing down SDLC artifacts within the Service Level Agreements and to proactively avoid NCIs and URs being raised before it gets into the auditing review queue. These practices also helped in improving the stakeholder partnership and ownership in response to SDLC artifacts.

Manoj and the Technical Program Manager led the digital scrum teams offshore and managed the portfolios of the PMO group. They understood the clinical challenges in tracking artifacts within the SDLC phases. Manoj identified gaps in the system where the PMO group was not adopting Agile methods to solve issues. He made sure all the portfolios underwent the SDLC adherence process that he developed. IPTMs were added as part of the scrum teams and the teams were made to work collaboratively with the stakeholders in resolving the NCI and UR backlogs. This allowed the SDLC artifacts to be closed in a couple of sprints.

The SDLC adherence process and practices were the result of Ninja Agile coaching skills pursued by Manoj from various TCS Programs. This helped Manoj to connect with the client’s problems and resulted in the progress of SDLC artifacts within a very short period of time as well as improved collaboration with key stakeholders to ensure timely closure.

This issue had been a key pain area for the client for a long time and there was no standard process in ensuring timely closure of artifacts for each release. The clients were extremely satisfied with the results Manoj had brought and appreciated him for efforts to bring down the CIO scorecard and getting SDLC artifacts closed within the time specified in the SLA.",Improving Cio Scorecard Of Digital Portfolios Using Agile Techniques,"M, Mr. KARTHEKEYAN (Karthekeyan)",Retail Banking,Agile Transformation,Growth & Transformation,Item,1
"Aaron was a Manager of Enterprise Data Warehouse (EDW) team in a leading bank based in the USA. The bank involved a third-party vendor to deliver the communications about the transaction, offers and other activities to the customer through paper, email or through other forms of digital communications. The vendor provided reconciliation files to the bank containing information on successful and unsuccessful deliveries. The input feed file used by Aaron’s EDW team during comparison with the reconciliation file for creating the reports were not in sorted order and also had few duplicates. This gave rise to an issue in the Enterprise Data Warehouse (EDW) feed creation process. The process increased Million Instructions Per Second (MIPS) consumption and resulted in increased spending for providing services to the customers. Aaron was concerned and wanted to reduce the MIPS consumption by the EDW program.

The client was one of the leading banks based in the USA with a global presence. The EDW team led by Aaron was facing issues with the input feed files since the files contained duplicates and were not in sorted order. The input file formed the feed to the EDW system for generating the reports. The reports were used by the Business Intelligence (BI) team for analytics to improve customer service. The EDW program read the reconciliation file to match with the input record. Once the match is found, the reconciliation file would close and open again to match with the next record. The process used more Million Instructions Per Second (MIPS) which has to be reduced to minimize the cost of providing service to the customer. The records that were not present in the reconciliation file would be marked as outstanding and would be processed in the next batch cycle.



Aaron wanted to find a solution to reduce the MIPS consumption without affecting the output created during the EDW feed creation process. Aaron approached TCS for a solution as TCS was already providing IT services to the client. TCS identified Hariraghavan S K as the Contextual Master for the program. Hariraghavan was associated with the client and had a deep knowledge of the client’s business processes, EDW platform, reconciliation file format and the stakeholder’s expectations.

Hariraghavan initiated an in-depth analysis of the EDW program functionality and part of the code responsible for consuming more MIPS. Hariraghavan also coordinated with various teams that were responsible for creating EDW feed. He devised a design approach to optimize the program. The optimized program had the input feed file in a sorted order based on a key and the duplicate records were removed. Once done, a call would be made to the compare logic within the program to compare the input record with the reconciliation file. Since the input feed file was in a sorted order and duplicates removed, the program would now open the reconciliation file only once and not for every input record. Thus, the solution helped to reduce MIPS consumption during the EDW feed creation process. Hariraghavan worked closely with the BI team to make sure that the report generated by the EDW program was accurate.

The program optimization implemented by Hariraghavan helped the client to reduce MIPS consumption in a big way. The new logic was successful in creating accurate and timely reports for the BI team to perform analytics. The reduction in MIPS consumption helped the client to realize a huge savings of $104,942.99. The solution helped the client to minimize the cost of providing service to the customer and at the same time improve the customer service. The client management appreciated Hariraghavan for the optimization which helped them to reduce the MIPS consumption.",Https://Knome.Ultimatix.Net/Blogposts/589484,SHAROAN Mohammed,Enterprise Applications,Process optimization,Cost & Optimization,Item,1
"Adam was the CMO of a leading North American Airlines. One day while grabbing a quick coffee with his peer, he explored the idea of making changes to the rewards program of their partner bank. Adam believed such a change would attract more customers to their airlines. Thus he quickly reached out to Roger, the CTO of the largest North American bank and also a long-standing partner of the airlines’ company.

Adam explained to Roger that the primary requirement was to abide by the contractual agreement and make significant changes in the bank card system functionality. Adam also said that the change would involve the migration of portfolios from one into another with a set of complex criteria to implement in the rewards area. Roger was quick to put on his thinking cap and realized that the bank cards did not have the rewards architecture, and building a new architecture was a daunting task.

Therefore, Roger spoke to other stakeholders of the bank and decided to rope in TCS for the task as the bank had a long-standing relationship with TCS. Soon, Arun Palanivel from TCS was given the ownership of the project. Arun was an ideal choice as he was highly experienced in the banking domain, especially in the rewards area. Moreover, he had worked in the rewards area of the banking sector for more than thirteen years and so possessed contextual knowledge about the existing rewards program and the gaps that existed. Additionally, Arun and his team tried to gauge more about the client’s requirements so that they could come up with the most viable solution. The primary goal was to devise a solution that was both cost-effective and abided by the contractual agreement.



Arun used his contextual knowledge about the US banking sector’s rewards area to understand the architecture and come up with an innovative solution. He proposed reusing the existing product change process to trigger the expected architecture with as minimal as 500 to 600 lines of code changed in the existing architecture. This was a breakthrough.

Finally, Portfolio migration was accomplished well-in-advance without any issues or any impacts on any of the cardmembers. This made both the bank and the airlines happy. Also, the cardholders were delighted with the additional benefits that they received on the cards.

The client was immensely happy with the efforts put in by Arun and his team and sent high appreciation for him. TCS, not only gained the bank’s trust but also bagged additional projects.",Redesigning Simplified Rewards System,SHAROAN Mohammed,Cards,Legacy Transformation,Growth & Transformation,Item,1
"Adopting advanced technology is a natural process. The client of TCS, a large US-based bank, was in the process of migrating one of its major businesses from a legacy platform to a market-pioneering one in the third quarter of the financial year 2019. Pre-implementation tests at one of its critical interfacing applications revealed that transaction volumes would be higher than anticipated during this transition period, which would adversely impact its premium clients. Any delays due to the high volumes would hinder go-live for this transition in the bank’s capital markets arena. With Q4FY19 as the deadline, there wasn’t a lot of time at hand.

Having won this account in May 2018, TCS was keen to showcase our client commitment capabilities and prevent financial and reputational loss to the bank. As a technical architect, TCSer Debarghya Choudhury had in-depth expertise in interfacing with systems via MQ messaging and was familiar with the client’s infrastructure. Thanks to his contextual knowledge of the client organization and environment, he figured out that there was another application at the bank that dealt with similar messaging with the same external system, and which also had TCS presence.

Debarghya also identified that the transaction processing delays were happening because of the way the messages were being parsed. He worked with the other TCS team to understand the external application and its various message types. He gained in-depth knowledge of how the messages were being consumed, parsed and processed within the application.
He began working on the MQ message parsing and explored alternate options. Using test regions such as QA and T020, which were available with the partnering system, Debarghya analyzed performance and processing efficiencies. He identified that the processing slowness was due to the way messages were parsed at the bank and proposed to change that from DOM to SAX parser to speed up the transaction processing.



Having convinced the client through a PoC, Debarghya helped the bank scale up from 1,000 messages per minute to 4,000 messages per minute. Go-live was also achieved by Q4FY19 as per the bank’s initial plan, despite the larger volumes tackled. The client’s senior management was thrilled with these milestones and TCS managed to not just retain the 2018 contract (worth $700,000), but also renew it for the subsequent year ($1 million).",Facilitating A Bigbang Platform Transition At A Usbased Bank Despite Raised Volumes,N.

"Agile is an approach to software development emphasizing on incremental deliveries, team collaboration, continuous planning and continuous learning. This was the approach that David, the new CIO of one of the auto finance giants wanted to bring to his organization. He wanted to change the environment with ‘focused, forward, fast’ approach to bring more agility to the functioning of the organization. He wanted to adopt agile methodology for development and segregated support team as L2/L3 groups. The change happened so rapidly that the operations and business teams panicked.

The client is one of the auto finance giants in the United States. The client shifted their headquarters from California to Dallas in 2017. Many functional Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) left the organization when the headquarters was moved. Moreover, the changes brought in by the new CIO in 2018 made the operations and business teams uncomfortable and set them in a panic mode. The management were unable to draft a strategic plan to bring stability in the IT services. TCS has been a long-time partner of the client delivering quality IT solutions. The client sought the help of TCS to implement solutions to bring stability to its IT services at the earliest.

TCS named Gautam Mondal as the Contextual Master (CM) who has vast experience in application support projects of the customer encompassing core business areas. Gautam in his 6 years of association with the client has played a variety of roles from Technical Manager (TM) to Service Delivery Manager (SDM). Gautam has gained immense knowledge on business landscape, clear understanding on criticality of business, knowledge on end-to-end service management and expectations of the stakeholders.

Gautam playing the role of SDM for all the support projects in TCS will now be playing a core consultant role for this project. His experience of having played various roles has helped him to strategize tasks efficiently to bring in stability in the operations. His understanding of client’s business, process and culture also helped in drafting strategies. He was quick in assessing the situation and established teams with optimum size and with a right mix of skill sets . He also engaged the Business Process Services (BPS) team to cut down cost and placed strong technical members in T&M positions for revenue growth.

The activities that were involved to Run The Business (RTB) were analysed so that Gautam could formulate the plans for Change The Business (CTB). Gautam also formed dedicated teams to identify the areas that could be automated and the same was shared with the client teams on a regular basis. This helped to implement the automation process in a smooth manner with the cooperation of users. Gautam’s team discussed with business users to understand their pain areas so that he could work on the CTB plan to provide a better user experience. Gautam made a smart and proactive move in engaging Speed and Race Technology (SRT) experts during major implementations so that the integration would be seamless.

Gautam and his team provided robust automated solutions that provided great stability to the IT services of the client. The changes were done in a seamless manner that the results looked as if nothing has changed. The automation enabled better collaboration between development, L2, L3 support teams. This ensured that the new functionalities rolled out by development team were supported by the L2/L3 support teams in a smooth manner. This resulted in less turnaround time for requests and user experience was enriched. The client was extremely delighted with the automation and the stability it brought to IT services. Customer expressed their gratification with a 100% CSS for the first time in Client-TCS AMS relationship.

"Ahmar, a client of one of the largest credit card companies in the US, was worried about a technology upgrade at the company. His worry was shared by several credit card partners of the company. The proposed project required upgrading the technology stack of their website that covers more than 25 million business users and gets more than 20,000 hits each day involving the processing of more than $2 billion in payments. The stack supported 13 products and included six partners across three different locales.

Ahmar convinced company CTO Francis Griffin that the project be handed to TCS and the consultancy, in its association with the company for more than a decade, had delivered several solutions successfully. With Francis’ nod, Ahmar got TCS associate Jayasri and team to provide a solution without affecting partner firms of the company. Jayasri had worked with the company for more than 10 years. She used the contextual knowledge and up to date knowledge of digital and cloud technologies to develop a solution.



She laid out a plan and proposed a solution that included migrating all the existing more than 150 legacy services to microservices by integrating and deploying them into a cloud environment using Next Gen architecture within 9 months. She received the go-ahead and adopted Agile methodology to switch the program deliver the migration. The quick delivery of the project was appreciated by Ahmar and the company leadership as it brought huge cost savings to the tune of $100 million. And with the migration, the company was also able to decommission the app servers and webservers used by the legacy system.

Jayasri and team were able migrate all the services that were initially planned for Phase 1 of migration and delivered these on time without impacting the existing partners. It created a good impression about the digital delivery capabilities of TCS. The company grew increasingly comfortable with TCS and added new retail partners with which it also gave TCS new projects in quick succession. Jayasri’s team grew from 10 members to 70 members within just 1 year. Now the team leads digital technologies and helps other teams in achieving their targets with new digital migrations.

Jayasri being technical lead and principal engineer was constantly keeping up with the trending technologies. TCS helped her to shape and improve her contextual skills using learning platforms and training sessions. She used them prudently and with her contextual knowledge and digital skills was able to achieve what was considered to be one of the toughest migrations handled by the consultancy till then.",Applications Upgrade With Minimum Service Disruptions,Sunil John,Cards,Technology Infrastructure,Growth & Transformation,Item,1
"An otherwise sound sleeper, Dennis could not get a wink of shut-eye lately. As the CTO of a major US-based bank, he was always worried. The cause of his worry was the email he’d recently received from the vendor of his loan management system. They would stop supporting the system Paradata at the end of their license term. He decided to migrate the solution to a new product called SHAW Spectrum. But he knew that the migration would take considerable time, given the quantum of data to be shifted.

He urgently needed someone to understand the Paradata Unix system, that was built using Acu Cobol and C programs mounted in Unix box, and provide maintenance/enhancement support. The project would also entail system replacement and integration with other technologies currently being used by various business operations.

Having worked with the client since 2005 for all their initiatives, including several migration requests, TCS was the natural choice for the project. TCS brought in Sivapriya S to lead this project. Working as the Technical Lead at offshore, her experience of mainframe and Unix would come in handy for this project. The first step was to understand the functionalities of the Paradata system, and it’s inbound and outbound interfaces within the strict deadline.

Only then would she be able to handle any changes in the system and offer L3/L4 support. She set out to analyze the full range of programs and files, but the delay in the region-wise set up put a spanner in her work. Left with only the programs that had been extracted in notepad, she began her investigation. She also studied the ticket history for the past year.

Her research allowed her to breakdown the functionalities and classify over 4000 Cobol programs based on complexities. She then created online screens to convert the ISAM files into readable formats and a tool to generate program statements. Master list of the reports generated out of Paradata was captured, and enhancements carried out in the system to check the migration status of a given account to SHAW. Program analysis was simplified by utilizing various tools and by automating the process of expanding inline routines. Sivapriya also designed a tool to extract three items from the program: file operations performed, sub-routines called, and the input/output file.

Her solution covered 560 jobs as part of the inbound/outbound interfaces. She further developed an entity-relationship diagram for the Paradata local files and runbook with all the solutions/processes to help the maintenance process. The client was thrilled with the solution and was confident in TCS’ abilities to handle the maintenance and enhancement requests.

"Are you or do you know anyone who works as a Software Developer? Then you’d know the importance of the Development Lifecycle and the processes that follow. Software Developers play an integral part in the maintenance and enhancements of services and offerings of businesses of all sizes. Embarking on an organizational transformation with DevOps can be a massive undertaking. It can be downright overwhelming when we consider the size of any large financial organization.

A leading multinational Financial Organization is one such example. The Consumer Division of the organization was in need of enhancements to its consumer-based application. The current set-up relied on an in-house private cloud to store and maintain data. However, the legacy system was outdated which led to compromises in the quality of data and vulnerable to cyber-attacks. Realizing the importance to upgrade their application infrastructure with minimal to no disruptions to maintain a positive customer experience, the client turned to TCS.

Shamik Banerjee was tasked with this challenge. Shamik came with an impressive portfolio of experience and expertise in the domain. Backed by his skills and knowledge gathered working on similar projects in the past, Shamik took the challenge head-on. Shamik set about tackling the challenge by first initiating an investigation on the ongoing situation. Based on his research, Shamil found that due to the nature of the organization’s structure, there were multiple development standards. Each team operated in Silos without the efficiency of Process and Automation but relying on individuals. He also realized that the diverse technologies ranging across Mainframe, Cloud, and SalesForce make it difficult to carve a repeatable pattern for automation. Additionally, there was already a lot of investment in procuring off-the-shelf automation and infrastructure tools with no tangible ROI.

The challenge that lay before Shamik was to enable transformation with minimal disruption and yet address the desired throughput improvement. Shamik created a blueprint that tackled the challenge in a 3-tier approach – achieve in-built governance, minimize hand-offs, and enable Developer self-service.

Shamik implemented his approach by interacting with stakeholders across different application teams and roles. He created a knowledge base of existing application lifecycle processes that covered across phases. These processes were refined as Patterns that were eventually converted into Pillars of the framework UNIFY. Owing to the inability of conventional CICD tools and models to go beyond the boundaries of Build and Deploy, UNIFY was designed to be a common orchestrator across the application lifecycle.
Shamik and his team worked tirelessly to implement end-to-end integration and monitored the application quality in each phase.

Shamik successfully migrated the in-house hosted private cloud to vendor managed Platform in a short span of 6 months.

"As the newly appointed senior project manager of a renowned bank, Clara was constantly finding ways to deploy beneficial programs. During one of her analysis sessions, she came to know about the challenges faced by the Regional Innovation lab of her bank. Hence, Clara was dedicated to coming up with a reliable solution. The Regional Innovation lab was mandated to identify new products and services related to its Treasury and Trade Solutions (TTS) business.

Clara knew that the deliverables of the lab were in the form of multiple Proof of Concepts (PoC) and Pilots, which did not follow a linear execution path. There were only limited resources available in the lab. The most important challenges identified were the lack of traceability of each PoC/Pilot’s progress, resource capacity management, and visibility to wider stakeholders like product partners and other regional labs of the client. To Clara’s dismay, all these pain points eventually led to an unstructured execution model. The product sales and relationship managers were unable to commit to their institutional clients.

The clients even started looking towards other competitors for assistance. With no further thoughts, she decided to approach their IT partner, TCS, who was supporting their Innovation lab. TCS was given the requirement to implement a management framework from scratch covering all of the knowledge areas of project management and to train the lab members on this framework, which would lead to discipline in the execution. As a result of which, Romit Kumar was assigned by the TCS manager to lead this project. Romit understood that innovation projects had a very different trajectory in terms of discovering the pain points and pinning the problem statement using various design thinking methodologies. Also, it followed a different approach in validating a high-fidelity prototype, developing a PoC, and delivering the solution at scale with selected pilot clients.

Knowing about the changing nature of the requirements, Romit proposed an adaptive framework for project execution, i.e. Scrum and Kanban for capacity management. He had to switch from Scrum master to program manager, depending on the context. Romit constantly coached the team on Scrum and tailored the framework to meet lab-specific requirements, focusing more on the ‘Age’ of an item than team velocity. It had to be done to predict the estimated time to move the remaining product backlog items to ‘done’. This technical ability to decompose complete scope into smaller increments was regarded as a critical success factor! With his contextual understanding, Romit understood the ‘visual’ nature of the lab business head and demonstrated the success of POC in a few weeks by implementing Scrum.

Then, he scaled up the scrum framework to all executing PoC and pilots. The lab executed multiple projects in a quicker timeline. So, here, Romit had to address the problem of capacity management, and he suggested using a digital Kanban board for making the assigned tasks visible to the leadership team. Additionally, a Gantt chart was maintained to map the Lab’s Book of Work (BoW) with the resource requirements. Romit handled a program level dashboard in Jira to showcase the progress of the projects.

"Aston* was working in the loan processing department of a major financial institution in the US and he had been under a lot of pressure to quicken the processing of commercial loans. Unfortunately, the existing processes entailed a lot of manual effort and the team did not have enough bandwidth to manage the load. Moreover, the manual efforts resulted in many errors as well and Aston was struggling to motivate his team members and keep the process going.

When he could do it no more, he approached the management and when this was escalated, the higher management decided it was time to use advanced technologies like machine learning to automate many activities so they can lay the foundation for the future and improve productivity as well.

The management approached TCS and Animesh Das was assigned to this project because of his eight years of experience in working with the client. Over the last few years, Animesh had gained extensive contextual knowledge about the client and understood the systems and processes well. With the help of his technical expertise and profound knowledge, he came up with the idea of DevOps to automate the testing phase of the project. He had designed many solutions for the client over the last eight years in various capacities and this made him the right choice for this project.

Animesh took a methodical approach to the problem. He had discussions with the senior management to list out the requirements and based on it, he formed a TCS team with the best possible knowledge in this relatively new area. The team was formed with employees across different locations and it took time for everyone to settle down.

Together, the team learned, innovated, and eventually came up with a brilliant solution to meet the client's problem. He arranged stakeholder meetings and used his relationship at a strategic level to narrow down the approach and solution. With an in-depth understanding of the client business and IT landscape, Animesh created standard designs, demonstrated the prototype to end-users and automated the disparate processes in commercial loan processing. The final outcome met the requirements of all regulatory authorities. All through the implementation, Animesh used his technical expertise and his understanding of the client's systems to ensure that it was a successful one.

All these paid off and the customer began to think of many more use cases. Customer also highly appreciated the efforts of Animesh and his team. The new solution was shown to all business segment heads across different regions including the CEO of Citi Commercial Bank. It was appreciated by TCS as well, and this Machine Learning solution got shortlisted in TCS Innovista 2018 as well.

"At the headquarters of a leading bank in the US, George, the Finance Head and Leo, the IT Head were preparing for the upcoming iCAP audit. While doing so, they realised that many issues required attention before the audit.

For the double cash customers, there was 1% SOC, followed by addition of overpayment fields to award the missing dollars. This worked well with an iCAP. However, from the time the iCAP executive left the organisation, the new team were struggling to finish the audits. They were left with no details and artefacts of the issue to chase it to the closure. Also, based on the rule, the closure of the problem had to be done within a year of opening the iCAP, i.e. July 2018.

George and Leo were aware that missing to close the iCAP would hurt the credibility of the recovery team. Additionally, it would have a severe impact on the bank’s reputation during the audit. The TCS team had resources which had previously worked on the project to add the new fields and handled the recovery of the accounts for the iCAP. So, with less than six months in hand, George and Leo approached TCS to help them with the closure.

Upon understanding the task, the TCS team roped in Anurag Paul as a contextual master to drive the project. The reason was apparent. Anurag was involved in the structural changes with the Double Cash account accumulation for over nine years with the client. As a result, he had gained in-depth knowledge of the landscape. Besides, he was well aware of the challenges and had a good understanding of the standard artefacts. With the help of this acquired contextual knowledge, Anurag was able to implement a feasible solution.



At the start, a lot of rework was coming in the way as all the documents had to be retrieved and supplied with more relevant data. So, Anurag worked to pull all the old emails and recovery details which were marked in the incident. He revisited the recovery process, which was carried out in case questions were underlying the details of the recovery steps. Anurag ensured proper documentation and categorisation of the recovery steps, which helped to work on the issue effectively. To meet the deadlines, he recovered all the communication with the previous iCAP contact and assessed the situation. Moreover, Anurag worked on the live sessions with the clients to explain the movement of the accumulation amounts for the impacted accounts. Finally, Anurag reran the monthly reports from one-year-old data and plotted the progression of data via working sessions to allow the stakeholders to gather the required data for the iCAP audit.

Post-implementation, the client was happy because the new iCAP contacts were able to formulate the data and close the recovery within the deadline. Also, the records were clean with no audit issues.

"Automation has become a business necessity in this competitive era. It has given the ability to perform, work faster, more efficiently, at a higher quality. The client, a leading US-based Auto Finance company, went down the same route while looking for strategies to stay on top of their business and become market leaders.

The management decided to automate their Vehicle Lease-End process since most of the functions were running in legacy technologies with a lot of manual interventions. These processes were disjoint, and many stakeholders were involved. After the full term of a vehicle, the asset had to be returned to the dealership where the final inspection and different settlement cost were calculated. End customers were frustrated because they had to wait a lot of time for their final settlement until the process was completed. Their goal was to provide hassle-free Lease-End process to their end customers and dealers.

As preferred client partner TCS was asked to involve SMEs to prepare a solution blueprint after discussing with different stakeholders. This required end to end domain knowledge of Auto Finance Business process, understanding the current architecture and the technology footprint. Arindam Patranabis has been working for this client for the past twelve years and had a thorough knowledge of Auto Finance domain and also of the client specific processes.

Arindam had previously worked in several initiatives as a solution architect for the same client. Thus, he knew the challenges of Mainframe and AS400 based Legacy applications which were heavily involved in this business. With the help of this in-depth contextual knowledge, he prepared an architecture diagram of both existing and future business models. These diagrams were useful to automate the systems in real-time. Arindam’s solution required real-time interfaces between CRM (e.g. Salesforce) and back end legacy technologies (e.g. AS400 and Mainframe). The interface was built after a successful POC using Informatica Power Exchange and MuleSoft.

Arindam used his in-depth knowledge to decide the most beneficial solution for the client. He knew that they were keen to replace legacy technologies with new-age platforms. Therefore, he gave two solution approaches which were short term and long term. The first approach was for automating vehicle grounding process, and the other method was for all other lease end business processes. Vehicle Grounding solution automated the entire manual process of data entry in AS400 screens and build a real-time solution between CRM, Mainframe and AS400. As part of this solution, the underlying architecture framework was constructed to automate the other business process.

The short-term solution was implemented within two months of the time frame. It resolved the manual intervention of the vehicle grounding process (nearly 2000+ vehicles per day) and saved eighty hours of human effort every day. The solution opened a path between open and legacy technologies using Informatica Power exchange and MuleSoft. Furthermore, it resulted in building strong relationships and future engagements. All Lease end processes like Termination and Sale were automated using the same framework.",Drive Growth By Successful Automation,Mohit Goyal,Automative Finance,Automation,Cost & Optimization,Item,1
"Average Handle Time (AHT) is a critical metric to measure the call time of a customer from the time a customer calls until it was connected to the representative. The AHT determines customer churn and CSAT. The lower the AHT, the efficient the call center is, allowing the representatives to handle more calls for resolution. Longer waiting time reflects on the company's services and is prone to reputational damage.

Lujan, Head – Customer Service of a reputed global bank wanted to reduce the AHT and increase CSAT. The bank Customer Service team operated the ‘Collections Web Application’ (CWA) for all processes related to the cards collection. The collection agent handled calls of both business cards and retail card customers to reduce the delinquency by providing offers for the debt amount owed.
With the CWA having more than 100 web pages within the main Hub page, the agents had to navigate between various pages to acquire basic information required for each call. The navigation time between the pages increased the AHT of each call and affected the number of calls scheduled to be attended each day by each agent.



Lujan sought TCS’s advice, as they have been the strategic partner for 15+ years. Murali, who was assigned to the project, had been associated with the bank for the past 7 years and an SME for most of the functionalities of the CWA. Thinking from an agent’s perspective instead of a developer’s perspective, Murali proposed quite a few process improvements for AHT reduction, for eg., displaying basic and essential information required for each call on the CWA’s main hub page like the delinquency amounts due along with each month’s billing date. Lujan approved most of the ideas and gave her approval for the implementation.

Murali used the agile methodology to map the required data using the existing backend service calls during the loading of the main page. After the implementation, the AHT reduced resulting in a significant improvement in the service levels and increased CSAT. The efficiency of the call center agents also improved with the increase in the number of called handled in a day.

Lujan was extremely happy with the product and expressed her gratitude with a ‘Galaxy of Thanks’ through emails and certificates. One of Murali’s PI idea was logged in IMPACT (391368) system as ‘UCD Enhancements-Hovers’ for soft savings estimated at $390K.

"Brexit had gained massive popularity in the UK and the world for more than one reason and the impact on the financial industry was estimated to be explosive. All was not the same for Charlie, the general manager of the UK entity of the client, who was literally eating his head in anticipation of the deal Brexit would end up taking. His anxiety wasn’t unfounded as whichever way it went, the ramifications were huge for his bank.

Being one of the Big 4 in the Banking Industry headquartered in the United States, the client had one of its subsidiary branches in London, UK. The UK Branch had four sub-entities registered in London and Ireland. It became imperative for the business to deregister themselves from Ireland and register in London for their continued operations in London, as the UK headed to a no-deal Brexit. For the client, it meant the creation of a new bank and transfer of the existing customers from Ireland entities to this new bank.

This mammoth task required herculean efforts across all business processes from ledger transfers to payment processing, from saving accounts to investment bookings. Being the trusted partner of the client for years now, TCS pitched in to ensure a smooth creation and transition guiding the client-stakeholders at every step along the way.

As the stakes were riding high on the millions as well as the potential reputational loss for any gaffes whatsoever along the way, the client sought for the availability of all the domain SMEs on the project to be available on-shore throughout the course of the project. TCS braced up for the challenge and enabled new SMEs to be transitioned for availability off-shore.

Manikandan, one of the senior-most consultants with versatile experience across all the domains was chosen as the contextual master to lead the team. Manikandan and his talented got together and signed off on every single requirement, from design to creation and validation, ensuring every single parameter was rightly validated and regressed. They categorized 1500 plus test cases for function stories while another 1200 plus cases for regression cutting across 23 systems.

Mani’s UAT team helped in giving a phased go-ahead for the client to balance the books and move forward to new ledgers from one entity to another. During the actual implementation, the entire TCS team facing this client, turned up over the weekends that warranted a continuous 48 hours at the office, which was also, planned, facilitated and executed methodically under the able leadership of Mani. TCS helped the client save a whopping $400M in the process.

From the mid-level directors to senior ones including Charlie were ecstatic with the level of perfection in execution of this transition that they unanimously recommended an award of £250 for the team. The reputation of Manikandan and his entire team increased many-fold just due to this project.The success of this reached far and wide in the client organization which in turn brought in more business engagements from the clients.",Leveraging The Tcss Knowledge Powerhouse To Create A New Bank,"Krishnamani, Mr. Vijay (Vijay Krishnamani)",Commercial Banking,Test Automation,Cost & Optimization,Item,8
"Brian* was the chief sales officer of a leading insurance provider in the US. The annual general meeting was approaching, and he had to be ready with the facts and figures concerning the sales figures and revenue earned. When he sat down with all the reports, he realised that the organisation was facing a higher than standard Policy Lapse Rate which in turn resulted in a loss of about five per cent of their policies every year. The results reflected that the loss created a ripple effect bringing about a reduction of revenue from premium. Brian was quick enough to realise that the issue needs attention, and so he brought this up during the annual general meeting. The leadership team of the insurance company seemed worried and carried on a series of meetings among themselves.

At last, they decided to seek help from TCS because they had been the trusted partner since 2013. The client wanted TCS to unearth the underlying cause of the downfall and help customer diminish the policy lapse rate. Upon understanding the problem, TCS decided that Rishi Dadhich would be the best fit to handle the task. The reason was that Rishi had acquired knowledge of the Life Insurance and Annuities domain over the past ten years. Moreover, he was meticulous enough to gather contextual knowledge about the client’s business processes and IT landscape by talking to senior stakeholders of the organisation. As he understood the exact requirement it became easier for him to work in the right direction.

As Rishi was involved with the client since the beginning of the partnership with TCS he had gained an in-depth understanding of the client’s business landscape. Hence, he could think of “Predictive Analytics” as a most befitting module to identify the potential policy defaulters. Rishi used his contextual knowledge about the client and Life Insurance and Annuities to deploy a data-driven analysis and find out the reasons for delays in payment on part of the customers.

As a next step Rishi put together a team of experts on the life insurance domain to analyse the client’s customer base across twenty-six parameters, which were precisely decided by Rishi. He could choose the twenty-six parameters because he had a good understanding of customer requirement with his years of experience. This was done to discover payers from which gender, state or region falls more among defaulters. Based on the findings a model was developed throwing insights on the lapse rate, which in turn, helped them devise a policy retention strategy.

Immediately after the implementation of Rishi’s strategy, the impact was felt. There was a reduction in call volumes. The model enabled sending pro-active reminders to potential defaulters and develop appropriate collection strategies. Besides, the client could identify blocks of products that were more lapse prone and make appropriate adjustments to the corresponding product features. Gradually the client could capitalise on the issue of policies lapsing and used a few of the recommendations provided by TCS like optimisation of payment mode and payment types at the customer level, to retain some of the customers that they would have otherwise lost.

The client was more than happy and Rishi, and his team received immense appreciation. TCS, on the other hand, became the chosen partner of the client for other such initiatives.

"Brian* was the head of the GDLM project of a leading bank that had operations in many countries around the world. When the operations began growing, he decided it was time to have a dedicated support team to handle the problems that came with the underlying systems and infrastructure. After getting clearance from the management, he hired the TCS team in Jan 2017. This team was in charge of providing APAC SIT/UAT batch support and defect management at the initial stages. Soon, the team found that though most of the topics like pre batch activity, repeated abends solution, critical jobs, etc was documented and could be handled with the help of application teams, there was no doubt that many of the tasks were manual and this made it difficult to measure some key metrics and KPIs. The TCS team believed that this hampered productivity and increased dependence on a few resources, not to mention the possibility of errors that came with the manual process.

During a regular review meeting, this was raised by the TCS head to Brian and it was mutually agreed to look into the different ways by which these tasks can be automated. After the formal nod, the TCS GDLM team identified all the time-consuming tasks and planned to implement more automation and tools to avoid manual work, resource dependencies, and improve the batch KPI’s. These objectives were in tune with brian's expectations.

But implementing them was not easy because of the limited tools and lack of expertise in these areas. This is when Vinodh Kumar, a batch lead with many years of experience with this client, came into the picture. Since he had been with this client, he had a good rapport with the GDLM team and managers and more importantly, he thoroughly understood the requirements and the problems impeding the automation of many processes.

He met the client and took regular feedback from Brian and others from the client team. Based on this feedback, he coordinated with the onshore and offshore teams to create a dedicated sub-team and gave them the task of gaining more knowledge about the systems, tools, and automation. Alongside this, he brainstormed with TCS experts to come up with different innovative ideas to implement automation among batch and production jobs. His knowledge about the client's systems as well as his expertise in automation came to the fore in addressing these challenges.

With such concerted efforts, Vinodh and his team were able to identify the particular areas in the batch processes and implemented many tools and automation to meet the client's expectations. The GDLM client was glad to see our batch tools and automation and this helped to develop TCS's business and sustain its contract for another 3yrs, with the addition of the EMEA region's support along with APAC region that eventually brought additional income to TCS.

"Carla was in the room with her company, one of the largest banking organizations, signed a contract with TCS. They had decided to take over the transition of global production assurance for all the applications. As part of this vendor consolidation process, more than eleven hundred application support transitions were started with a number of different service providers in the market.

It was a stressful moment for Carla. There were few applications where the support from India was not possible due to the data privacy restrictions imposed. In addition to that, TCS on-site staffing was not adequate to handle the business-critical application support.

Due to the competitive mindset and poor cooperation, the expected warm handshake of knowledge between TCS and incumbent vendors went into unexpected complexities. This started impacting the business, as several user queries, incidents and problems began piling up without proper resolution impacting the defined SLAs.

Abhinab from TCS stepped up. He had over ten years of experience in application support projects. Having spent sufficient time with the client and gaining contextual experience in the field, Abhinab was the right choice to bring a solution to the client’s turbulent phase.

To mitigate the problem, Abhinab collaborated with a couple of SMEs who had a good experience in application support and conducted a detailed analysis of the situation. Based on various discussions with the client, he understood more about the quality of application support services and their performances. All the involved stakeholders realized the gaps that led to client dissatisfaction and created a disruption to the business. It was agreed to re-do the knowledge transition with step by step review of the progress between both parties and validation by the customer. Abhinab prepared and published a well-designed transition plan with fixed timelines for each phase of specific deliverables. The same was reviewed and agreed upon by the client.

All the KT sessions were recorded. Abhi and his team did multiple revisions of the recordings and documents to understand the application specifics, business deliverables, database objects and data flows. Before every knowledge sharing session, they went prepared with a set of questionnaires focusing on ongoing application issues and their possible resolution. With the available application access, they did a pro-active analysis on the existing and repeating problems, identified and validated the solution with both incumbent and customers. With this approach, the client believed in them and allowed them to move into secondary ownership support, followed by a quick transition to primary ownership support of the application.

During the transition, they did an excellent proactive analysis of the application code and connected the dots between business flow, code functionalities and the batch processing of the data. This made it easier for the team to build their expertise around the resolution of application issues with quicker turnaround time.

Abhinab and his team analyzed the whole IT architecture and the processes followed across business functions. Along with historical data on incidents in each of the areas, they managed to identify the pain areas and then suggest solutions through service improvements, process improvements and change in architecture that led to the reduction of incidents and created a permanent resolution to problems.",Building Bridges With Contextual Expertise,SHAROAN Mohammed,Cards,Production Management,Cost & Optimization,Item,2
"Carlos* was the Head of customer communications in the Brazil division of a well-known banking institution with its headquarters in North America. His unit was committed to performing a major customer statement transformation within a very short span of time and the target was to get it implemented before the Christmas holidays. The existing application generated statements in legacy black and white format and they wanted to move over to a colorful and more presentable statement format. This transformation program demanded many architectural changes across multiple regions and multiple platforms. The team was racing against time to arrive at the optimal solution.

Carlos and his team understood that new software was needed to transform the statements. The software was required to have the capability of taking in the raw legacy data and processing the same to produce an informative and colorful statement for pleasant customer viewing.

"Change in Terms (CIT) is a very sensitive process in the payment Cards Industry. This happens when the Bank changes one or more terms which is different from what was disclosed at the time of account opening. Communication to card members and then changing the card feature per that communication is way more complex and even a small mistake/deviation from disclosures can draw legal attention. Especially when CIT involves an increase of fees on accounts and that has direct impacts to revenue, the whole process becomes way more sensitive.

Harry worked in the credit card division of a leading North American Bank. He had a challenging project of communicating 33 MM customers and changing their Fee structure across their credit card product line. This project had to be executed in a timely manner with utmost care. All of the Card members had to be communicated successfully through paper or digital channel and after certain opt-out period fees on these accounts were supposed to be changed to the new structure. New fee structure was increasing Late Fee, Min-Due, Foreign Fee and on some product annual membership fees. Customer consent was a prerequisite. Return mail or letters (both in digital and physical form) had to be tracked and the response captured

Harry was happy to have Srikanth Adurti from TCS with over 14 years of working knowledge in the Bank’s US platform and a subject matter expert in similar CIT projects, to spearhead this initiative. Srikanth’s challenge was to build a good team which can work round the clock in an offshore, onshore model and get this project delivered. He suggested the project team break this large volume into several smaller groups of card members based on their product feature (club similar products in the same group). He proposed a phased communication of the product lines and pricing changes. He also had to address the customer concerns post install and be prepared for any surge in responses. So post install, a smooth transition to customer service and prod support was needed.



Srikanth’s expertise in the pricing area enabled him to propose a detailed laid out plan for this CIT. He came up with a unique scheduling of mails that gave visibility towards customer communication. He designed a way to handle end to end communication with customers starting from a letter request being sent to the print team and that being finally delivered to the customer through post. He simultaneously laid out how these pricing changes were going to affect customers who had a returned mail. The unique design effected change in only the desired Fee feature, like Annual Fee, Late-Fee, Return Check Fee, and Late Payment Fee. Others like Foreign Fee and Balcon Fee were unaffected. As per the design all of these accounts had to go through a detail mapping exercise so that GOTO Fee is correctly mapped. He came up with an automated process of mapping these 33 MM accounts.

An approach note from Srikanth detailing how successfully this CIT was going to be executed with a positive revenue impact to the bank was highly rated by the customer. Srikanth and his TCS team planned for enough number of mock runs before the final install to ensure that the designed process was working as expected.

Relentless effort from Srikanth and his team enabled the bank to successfully execute the CIT on 33MM accounts. This CIT helped the bank increase their Cards receivable revenue by $17 MM Annually. Srikanth was well appreciated by the client and this recognition earned him and his team the Best Team award from TCS.",Communicating Change In Terms To Credit Card Customers In Time And Without Errors,SHAROAN Mohammed,Cards,Regulatory & Compliance,Growth & Transformation,Item,1

"Change is the only constant thing. Having said that, it is good practice to adapt to them without fail. Mike realized that his bank was running at high risk because of the recent policy change. This change required all financial institutions to be compliant for the two-factor authentication (2FA). This mandated the existing legacy job scheduler – Tivoli Workload Scheduler (TWS) as a non-strategic tool and non-compliant as per 2FA requirements. The timeframe to become 2FA compliant was by the end of Oct-2018 (6 months).

Mike worked for a leading multinational investment banking and financial services corporation doing business in more than 160 countries and had over 200 million customers and an employee base of 210,000. The daunting challenge faced was “How to migrate 20,000 jobs, within a timeframe of 6 months, cutting across all Line of Business (LOB), across 16 countries in a seamless way without any disruption to the existing process as the jobs are extremely complex and require the systems to be responsive 24x7”?

The migration process from legacy job scheduler to a new automated job scheduler (Autosys) required extensive testing. It was also time-consuming. Considering the fixed timeline for 2FA compliance, the key for project success depended on the migration/rollout strategy. D V Subramanian was nominated to lead the initiative. He had worked with the client partner for the last 6+ years and gained contextual knowledge about the client's various systems, architecture. He also had a deep understanding of operations and business models which enabled him to prepare a roadmap for Autosys migration.






D V Subramanian decided to use his expertise to give TCS an advantage over other competitors and decided to go for automated script conversion using job information language (JIL). Sensing the need of the hour, he quickly formed an agile team who were quick learners, kick-started scrum/grooming sessions on requirements and rolled out a detailed plan for migrating 20,000 jobs to Autosys spreading over 18 cutovers between May-2018 to Oct-2018. This involved interaction/working of teams across various time zones from Asia, India, EMEA regions, thereby showcasing Onsite/Offshore/Nearshore models.

As a result of meticulous planning and relentless efforts from Dv, Subramanian and his team’s dedicated work for six months, the bank successfully migrated all 20,000 batch jobs to Autosys “On time with zero outage”. Subramanian and his team’s efforts were very much appreciated by Directors and Technical Heads. The complex batch migration helped the bank to meet the legal, regulatory and compliance mandates on time. The successful migration has given TCS an edge over other competitors!

This reduced the effort to manually track changes to the legacy environment. A phased approach by application was decided as the go-to-approach. This transparent approach raised confidence in TCS which established a leadership position among other vendors.",Large Scale And Complex Batch Job Migration For A Global Bfsi Client,Pranesh K,Investment Banking,Application Migration,Cost & Optimization,Item,1
"Charlie, the IT manager of a famous financial organization in North America, was slightly upset with the recent concern of microservice functionality. Recognized as the third-largest bank in the United States, all the applications of the company were supported by microservices running in cloud architecture as a part of Next-Gen architecture in 2019. With the running system in place, the microservices catalog was not efficient enough for capturing the reuse of any microservice with respect to the functionality. Due to this, a lot of duplicates API’s were getting developed across different lines of business of the client group in North America.

Charlie realized that the existing process was not able to enforce the reuse of API/Microservices. Hence duplicate API/Microservices were developed and deployed in the Cloud platform, which resulted in multiple occurrences of the production issues. It was a challenge to look for the best suitable reuse process to address the ongoing problem. Charlie thought for a while and had a quick discussion with the technical director of the company. As per the director’s recommendation, Charlie contacted their long-term strategic partner, TCS.
As TCS was associated with the client for a long time, it was easy for them to understand the client’s requirements. However, it was a big challenge for TCS to design a smart approach as a part of API management. So, TCS handed over the responsibility to Krishna, who was having 7+ years of stint with the client group. Krishna had to focus on the significant requirements such as updating the catalog with necessary metadata about an API. Next was to gather the necessary data and find a way to implement it in the centralized API management system so that it could be rolled out globally across the client regions.

As a project manager, Krishna had an in-depth understanding of the entire client group consumer banking and online finance applications. He took the responsibility of designing the solution and engaged respective technical teams for modifying different systems like Service Catalog and Sharepoint tool. He was also well versed in the internal culture and technical process of the client, which was very much needed during the solution implementation for reuse workflow. TCS provided Krishna and his team with the essential resources to come up with a timely solution.

The solution provided by Krishna and his team helped the applications team to identify if any existing API/Microservice could be leveraged for the implementation of new functionality, using the improved service catalog and Sharepoint tool, designed and developed as a part of Reuse workflow. It saved the development team’s time, substantial efforts and even expenses for implementing the new functionality. This successful implementation provided an easy way to identify and achieve the reuse of any existing API/Microservice, which benefited both the client and TCS in terms of automation and productive solutions.

"Clara, the Configuration Manager was hurriedly walking to the Scrum team’s bay to fix the issues in the code merger, missing scripts and component deployment. This had become a norm whenever the codebase was deployed. Clara’s team had to deploy the software in multiple environments. Due to Agile transformation, there were frequent deployments of code based from multiple scrum teams. The issues during deployment caused delay and impacted the availability of environments for business users.

The client was a banking organization and the largest data retailers in the United States. Due to the Agile model, the client deployed more than 100 dependent components from multiple Scrum teams once every 2 weeks to the production environment. Apart from Production, scheduled deployments happened in QA, SIT, PERT and UAT environments too on a daily basis. The issues in deployment delayed the environment from being available for end-users.

TCS was a preferred partner providing various IT services for the client. So, Clara decided to approach TCS for streamlining the deployment process. TCS identified Satish Kumaran who was associated with the client projects as the Contextual Master (CM) for the task. Satish had a good contextual knowledge on the client’s release management process, business practices and sound knowledge on Scrum methodology.

Satish played the role of a Scrum Master in the project. He interacted with multiple Scrum teams, product owners, Technical architects and Release teams to understand the pain areas. Satish was convinced that the implementation of CI/CD process was the only solution. The Scrum teams were made to automatically deploy the components across all the environments as per a scheduled window. He formed a DevOps team to streamline the process.

Satish implemented different branching strategies in the repository using the ROBO (Roll Out Back Out) plan. As per the plan, he implemented the Feature branch in the repository which enabled the Scrum team to roll back the faulty code changes without impacting the other components. As a Scrum master, he monitored the developers to prepare the required deployment scripts, DB configurations and automated test scripts. He streamlined all the process right from the lower environments to avoid conflicts in production deployment.

The successful implementation of CI/CD process by Satish’s team was well received by the client. The client was delighted to realize a reduction in the deployment window for all the environments. The scheduled automated deployment saved the Scrum team from their manual effort/time and was a great relief for the Release management team. The automated deployments also helped to reduce manual errors during deployments.

Clara was mighty impressed with the outcome of the solution.

"Client is one of the largest private sector Banks in USA having a footprint in all major countries and regions globally. They were concerned with the delay in eDelivery as it was dependent on the external IBM system. The eDelivery LatamLegacy application used to connect to the external IBM system for accessing the MQ queues that sent and received messages from the CX Host. Hence, eDelivery was largely dependent on the IBM system for testing the eDelivery’s development changes. However, the changes could not be tested prior to UAT and Production releases as the IBM setup for local environment was not feasible (whitelisting the server was not possible for local environment). The hold-up for the IBM server and MQ queues set up to be ready in UAT or PROD environment further delayed the eDelivery. Along with it there was a lingering possibility of having connectivity issues in the PROD environment, as the IBM MQ Queues could be tested only after the PROD deployment.

In face of these difficulties, Client connected with TCS to build a stand-alone application to test the IBM server connectivity and MQ queues response. This way they could do away with the dependency on IBM server setup’s readiness to test connectivity and MQ queues response before the deployment in UAT or Production. This would speed-up the testing process and avoid the connectivity issues in UAT and PROD before deployment.


Mohan Mani was onboarded for this job. He conducted an extensive analysis of the existing IBM connectivity techniques of implementation and came up with an approach to develop a stand-alone application. Based on the analysis, he developed a stand-alone application to load the IBM server, channel, queue and other details from the properties file. By using the properties file, just by changing the channel and queue names in the file, without any change in code, the application could run both in batch and normal mode based on the requirement.

After the deployment in Feb-2020, the stand-alone application was used to test the IBM server connectivity and queues response before the UAT or PROD deployment. It would identify any connectivity issues that eDelivery might face during testing and inform the corresponding IBM server team prior to the Production deployment. The team would then fix the issue and ensure that the IBM MQ setup was working fine. With this application in place, the effort required to test the connectivity during the deployment was reduced to nil. It also ensured that not a single defect was raised against the IBM Sever MQ Queue connection.

Client was extremely impressed with the implementation and appreciated Mohan’s contribution. They went ahead and started using this stand-alone application for other regions globally.",Abolishing The Dependency On External System By Developing A Standalone Application,SHAROAN Mohammed,Cards,OpEx,Cost & Optimization,Item,1
"Cory, the CEO of a financial service company, wanted to initiate the TS2 Conversion to the Card Mart Application. The program’s objective was to migrate consumer and small business accounts from the current TS1 system to the new TS2 platform(State -of- the- art card processing). The TS2 Card Conversion supported enhanced capabilities including better data and analytics, increased flexibility, speed to market with new products, decreased reliance on TSYS(Total Systems Services) for ongoing customization, and improved efficiencies. This program integrated 16 applications and more than 30 daily files into the new TS2 system.

However, the challenges involved were poor requirements: many times requirements were meticulously documented and cataloged, but they did not address the business objectives; instead they were created to demonstrate the progress and complexity of the project, talent deficit: the data warehouse project required experienced project members, data quality issues: failure to address significant data quality issues could lead to loss of trust in the data for the end-user groups consuming outputs from the warehouse for the first time, big bang approach: the failure to quickly iterate and frequently deliver the business value could often lead to loss of project momentum and executive sponsorship.

The company was a client of TCS. TCS had been taking care of their data warehousing ETL development and production support. Srinivas Reddy Konatham (ETL Architect) had played many roles across different domains for the client, as assigned by TCS, for over a decade. He gained hands-on experience of the client’s systems and processes while managing several implementations in the Data Warehouse projects and initiatives.

With a clear understanding of the client’s business and technology landscape, Srinivas Reddy and his team defined clear success criteria for each phase and inspected them until the completion to ensure that false velocity was not reported. Also, they designed data stage jobs that would automatically connect with the TS2 system and export data into the card mart application data warehouse. It would further be used to generate business reports.

The framework developed for this EDW project not only improved the company’s attractiveness to its customers but also made life better for the business staff. Such improvements may have manifested as cost savings, but it was hoped that the EDW’s impact would amount to something even more valuable, such as getting more done in a given amount of time or even making better decisions with less stress.

As a result of this implementation, a lot of manual effort and time was saved for the client. Thus, they appreciated the team.

"Dan* was a customer trying to access the online platform of a US-based Fortune 500 diverse financial organization for an important transaction, but he couldn't complete his transaction as the system was down. This seemed to happen often and Dan had to report it to the customer service team. He was clearly frustrated and said the same to the representative.

Since the frequency of such calls was enormously high, it was escalated and it finally reached Sam*, the owner of this critical application. He asked his team for a detailed analysis and understood that the frequency of downtimes increased greatly after a big technology modernization initiative. During the initial stages, the issues were sporadic and did not impact business availability and customer experience. But after some time, the number of such incidents ran into thousands and it started impacting business availability, and eventually customer satisfaction.

Though most organizations don't tend to give much importance to business availability and its resultant customer experience and financial impact, Sam thought otherwise. He felt this could give his business an advantage over competitors and presented the same to the management. Since TCS was providing support services to this client, it came to their plate, and there was intense pressure to fix these issues.

Prabhu Senthilkumar and his team were entrusted with the responsibility of improving business availability. During his 17 years of extensive experience in all technologies in host servers, Prabhu had gained deep operational knowledge of transactional services within host servers. He also knew the typical design pitfalls with respect to business availability and other non-functional requirements.
In general, non-functional transactional processing requirements vary between businesses, and also, the new architecture principles that guided the recent big technology modernization initiative could not be altered. Keeping these in mind, Prabhu analyzed the bottlenecks at different stages. He and his team did a deep analysis of all the logs and monitors in the systems and identified a bottleneck in one of the stages in transactional processing. He studied the new architecture principles, the rationale behind them, and also deliberated on how some of them could impact business availability. Weighing in on all these concerns and using a process of elimination of riskier solutions, he zeroed in on a solution that would reduce the bottlenecks drastically.

His solution was to enhance the memory management capabilities of transaction servers in host servers and he even suggested changes to reclaim the memory associated with orphaned/obsolete business objects. At the same time, the modularity and loosely-coupled nature of components were not compromised either. He even suggested the right memory location to reduce the possibility of security threats.

Prabhu's efforts paid off as the solution greatly improved business availability, without increasing business vulnerability. At the same time, it maintained the throughput and response time of insurance transactions. Eventually, the number of non-availability and timed-out incidents reduced significantly and it enhanced the customer’s reputation as a stable real-time service provider. This also added more business functionalities and efficient server usage, thus avoiding additional capital investment. Prabhu was well-appreciated and it led to a further boost in the relations between TCS and the client.",Improving Application Stability And Availability,SHAROAN Mohammed,Cards,OpEx,Cost & Optimization,Item,1
"Derek headed the IT department of a North American Bank with a global presence. The Bank had to maintain its reputation of having the fastest response time for Customer’s POS purchase in its credit card platform. This meant converting the legacy in-house built Fraud/credit risk platform to a more dynamic, improved risk detection capacity SAS platform which detects fraud/credit risk of a transaction more efficiently with minimal false positives.

Derek was tremendous pressure as the migration to Next-gen architecture involved several hops of going through multiple Application owning regions and get a decision back from the servers. The margin of error was very minimal as an outage of 1 hour in a peak time could result in a loss of 80 MM dollar worth of revenue and most importantly it will result in bad customer experience as customer’s credit card transactions could erroneously be declined by the issuer bank. Apart from keeping the systems running on both Legacy and the next-gen architecture, there was also the challenge of preventing fraud for this huge volume of transactions and the case processing system needed to be integrated with the next-gen architecture to prevent the fraud transactions causing losses to the customer/Bank.

Derek wanted TCS to take full ownership of the project with minimal involvement from their side. Rajesh Guru with over 11 years of working knowledge in the Bank’s US platform and a subject matter expert in similar projects, was assigned by TCS to spearhead this initiative. Rajesh had expertise in building multiple parallel platforms and multiple tools that would measure the performance of both the old and new process, compare the results via automated process to shed lights on the capacity and performance of the new system.
Rajesh with his experience working with the client, proposed a unique solution to make use of the flip switches to go back and forth the between the legacy and Next-gen system, throttle the volume of traffic being sent to Next-gen system and have performance






measurement at the checkpoints to fine-tune the system based on the learnings. As Rajesh and team progressed through the journey of stepping up the volume, the parallel systems efficiencies were measured from Capacity, Response time, Efficiency, Throughput and Fraud prevention parameters. The flip switch concept allowed the bank to go back and forth between legacy and the Next-gen side as needed and also to compare the efficiencies of the system with various automated tools proposed by Rajesh Guru and his TCS team.
Rajesh and his Team worked on this project for 6 Years before the bank could successfully convert all of the fraud/credit risk policies to the next-gen architecture. This conversion helped the Bank to significantly reduce the risk exposure associated with a transaction and also evaluate/implement new fraud rules in a lightning speed compared to the old legacy platform where it used to take almost a day or couple of hours outage to deploy an urgent policy requirement. Reduction of Risk and quick fraud detection resulted in higher NPS for the Bank.

Rajesh was well appreciated by Derek for his functional and contextual knowledge in the platform and this recognition earned him and his team the Best Team award from the Bank and TCS. TCS managed the entire show from design to implementation with minimal involvement from the bank. This helped TCS to gain trust from the Bank in terms of owning up other similar projects and establish our leadership position.v",Flip Switch Concept Helps Seamless Migration From Legacy To Nextgen System,SHAROAN Mohammed,Cards,Legacy Transformation,Growth & Transformation,Item,1

Sathiyanarayanan had technical understanding of how these channels interacted with legacy applications through TIBCO and MQ services. In addition, Sathiya also had domain knowledge of the functionalities involved in modernizing these activities.



A proof-of-concept was drafted by Sathiyanarayanan in order to ensure a smooth transition from the traditional approach of interacting with legacy applications via MQ and microservices to a modern way that involves splitting functionalities into multiple services using standalone APIs. These APIs could be consumed by any channel without the need of orchestration frameworks like TIBCO and MQ services.

However, the Z/OS Connect did not support all the features required for APIs, therefore Sathiyanarayanan and his team got rid of interfaces such as the TIBCO and MQ layers. This allowed the Z/OS connect to be used to convert heavily consumed services into APIs. After extensive UAT testing, production implementation was executed by placing a switch at the interface layer that routes the traffic to the BAU or API flow based on connectivity. This ensured that the customer did not face downtime while the channels were undergoing the transformation. Soon, Sathiyanarayanan and his team were able to develop full-fledged APIs for implementation in PROD with zero issues.

Sathiyanarayanan’s implementation helped the client achieve a simple end-to-end architecture that contains a thin mediation layer by avoiding dependencies caused by TIBCO and MQ services. The product team had end-to-end ownership that enables quality enhancements in the future and the simple end-to-end flow helped remove complex interfaces. The APIs developed for the channels had easy to use ‘Plug and Play’ functionality and made migration to Pivotal Cloud much easier.

Owing to Sathiyanarayanan's successful implementation, TCS was granted SOW to migrate all the legacy web services at the client’s side. This resulted in additional revenue and strong business partnership with the client for TCS while enabling the client to achieve digital transformation of channels and migration of web services into APIs.

"Digital transformation in channels such as Internet Banking, Mobile Banking, IVR, Customer Care Portal was the revolution in the banking and finance industry in 2018. CIB, a global leader in investment and financial services, looked to enhance their platform, equip themselves with the latest technology in order to provide their customers with the best experience in a race against their competitors.

However, the challenges lied in getting rid of old, complex interfaces and legacy applications and to keep the application up and running without any downtime while the transformation was being carried so that customer experience was not affected. This was when CIB connected with the TCS Architecture Team, who had already supported many transformation journeys, to help them facilitate their changes.

Sathiyanarayanan, an Application Lead with expertise in banking channels like Internet Banking, Mobile Baking, IVR, Customer Care Portals, was chosen to assist the transformation journey of the client. Sathiyanarayanan had technical understanding of how these channels interacted with legacy applications through TIBCO and MQ services.

"Digitization is known to convert the conventional formats into digitized formats, eliminating redundancies and shortening the communication process. Digitization is of utmost importance in today’s technically advanced world to stay abreast of the competition and in business. Digitization allows information of all kinds in all formats to be carried with the same efficiency.

One of the world’s leading banks desired to digitally transform their legacy Check Image Transmission Platform during 2018. The major challenge of the migration was the conversion of the existing CDs/DVs Exchange Platform to a secured service-oriented architecture platform that would enable the Check Images to be converted to a digitized electronic transmission format and transmit via the web-enabled services. Also, the new digital platform must be able to manage the high transaction volumes of the Check Images for more than 1000 corporate clients which otherwise would adversely impact the prime clients.

The bank was in the process of driving a major initiative to migrate to an external product – Smart Exchange. Inslee, the bank’s IT Chief utilized SMEs during the initial stage of the migration, but due to incompatibility, multiple failures were identified while trying to integrate the external product into the bank’s existing infrastructure. The unexpected failures and compatibility issues of integration hindered the migration process causing financial concerns. Inslee, however, did not lose hope and contacted TCS immediately.



Ganesh Narayanan who was assigned to the project led the critical digital migration donning the role of a Delivery Manager and conducted multiple sessions with the Technical Architects and Technical leads in understanding the pain points of the infrastructure integration and compatibility issues. Ganesh was hard-pressed for time with a very tight deadline and had to analyze the contributing factors for the prolonged migration.

Ganesh’s intuitive experience and direction helped in unwinding the reasons and the tasks were distributed and assigned accordingly. To continue with the process for a successful implementation, Ganesh chose the Proof-of-Concept with an alternate approach.
Earlier to the proposed changes, Inslee’s team was processing only for a few corporate clients due to the manual process and the cost associated with the CDs/DVDs conversion. After the implementation of the proposed Digital Check Image Transmission platform, the scope has been extended to 1000+ clients. The whole project went live as planned by early Q3-2019.

Inslee and the Sr. Leadership team were happy with the successful completion of this project with the aligned milestone. Ganesh Narayanan’s strategic thinking and massive efforts helped the project team in streamlining the approach and completed the digital Check Image platform transmission successfully. Also, the team ensured compatibility with the existing bank’s Infrastructure with zero defects promptly.",Digitisation Of A Legacy Platform,Mohit Goyal,Cards,Application Migration,Cost & Optimization,Item,1
"During COVID-19, when businesses across the globe are losing customers, some industries are thriving well. The reason is that they have already adopted automation which eliminates the need for manual communication. CICD - Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment is one of the most wanted and fast-growing techniques being adopted in today's marketing strategy to make more innovative automation techniques. Joanna, the CTO of a leading global bank, was already aware of the same. Hence, the bank was already on the way of migration, which replaced old systems and launched new developments across multiple countries in APAC and China regions. The entire program was with TCS.

However, Joanna, along with the senior leadership, decided that it would be best to accelerate the operation by reducing the overall cost. This meant automating the entire deployment and promotion concepts and fulfilling millions of personalized interactions. Joanna had understood that the lack of a CICD process was delaying product delivery timelines, impacting the billing and also customer relationship. Thus, the bank’s leadership team wanted a cloud solution that would provide an intelligent, unified platform. The goal was to improve the customer experience.

TCS, a long-term partner of the bank, was roped in for choosing the right product. A better product that could help them to reduce the manual time in deployment, integration and promotion process. Additionally, it should also have a customized tool that would help the developers make the development set up within a few seconds. At this juncture, Sathish SreedharaJayabalan from TCS was chosen to lead the initiative.

Sathish had more than nine years of experience with the client. Hence, he possessed immense contextual knowledge about the client’s business and their various systems. Sathish had to serve the role both of a Technical Lead and a Developer. The client organization had already clarified that the solution should be such that it should have a consolidated platform for digital communications and must sunset large portions of existing manual interventions without compromising on data security and with lesser time.

Sathish came up with a customized tool with the initial code setup and auto-configured code for developers. It helped the developers to download the entire package of code with a single click. Also, it eliminated the manual errors in an automation strategy and took care of the time-consuming issue. The solution had to be implemented with the CICD process; hence it required several approvals from different stakeholders. Once the necessary approvals were in place, all the developers started using the tool, which readily had all the code and configurations for the CICD process in it on a single click.

The tool with a remarkable automation tool on it enabled the client with a robust implementation, which eliminated manual intervention, thereby largely reducing the chances of errors. Initially, when the solution was implemented in the APAC region, it was a huge success, and later on, it was implemented in the Chinese market as well.

The client was delighted with the results and sent numerous accolades for Sathish and his team. TCS, on the other hand, continued to maintain its stronghold with the client.",A Robust Solution With An Automation Tool,SHAROAN Mohammed,Retail Banking,Automation,Growth & Transformation,Item,1
"During a casual conversation, Ron*, an employee of the reporting team of one of the world's largest banks told Sahil*, a TCS employee about the pains of his job. He explained that his team had to create a daily sampling of all the generated statements and had to load the same to the IBM CMOD tool. He had to do many searches across a ton of criteria and this frustrated him.

After motivating him a bit to get him through the day, Sahil brought this up to the TCS team. When Bibhash Paul heard about it, he immediately offered to help. Bibhash had been managing the client's OnDemand application and this gave him a thorough understanding of the client's landscape and IT architecture. He had 15 years of extensive knowledge in the mainframe system and during these years, he had automated many legacy processes as well. Given this experience, he knew that the automation of these manual processes will make life easy for Ron and his business unit.

Bibhash connected with Ron's business unit and it took quite some time for him to understand since the criteria to sample the accounts were complex and interlinked. Further, he understood that the unit had many challenges and they had to create the reports error-free every time. Moreover, it entailed time and effort in knowledge transition every time there was a change in the team's composition.






After collecting all the required data from the business unit, Bibhash dug through the OnDemand system to figure out if it was feasible to automate this process. There was no easy and handy solution, as the criteria were complicated and the business wanted to adhere to the same layout of the end report. With the contextual knowledge of the IBM CMOD tool and its internal customization in that organization, Bibhash was able to find a potential solution and proposed the same to the business unit. After multiple discussions and assurance that the business would receive the same report from an automation process, they agreed to open a project to implement the same. Implementing the proposal was a big challenge as multiple complex search logic needed to be applied, without impacting each other and without consuming many resources like CPU and elapsed time. Another challenge was to format the report in the same layout.

After multiple rounds of validation and modification, the client finally agreed to accept the report. Ron and other team members of this business unit were amazed to see that they could get the same report without any manual work and this excited them beyond words. What was once deemed impossible, became a reality because of the contextual knowledge of Bibhash. Undoubtedly, the business unit praised Bibhash and his team for this incredible work that saved them from the nightmare of having incorrect reports and also saved them half the FTE effort (approx. $50-60k annually).

This effort also boosted TCS's credibility within the organization and this led to more projects in the future.",Automating The Generation Of Sampling Reports,AMIT KUMAR SONI,Retail Banking,Reporting,Cost & Optimization,Item,1
"Elena*, the marketing head of the largest North American bank’s mission was to convert all of the card accounts of their consumers’ within the US mainland to their homegrown platform. In their current system, the card accounts of all the consumers within this US territory were maintained and serviced at banks’ Asia Pacific platform and hence the corresponding data residing outside US.

In addition, Elena’s team also faced a challenge to make changes on their two platforms which is required to meet the service level obligations for their consumers within this US territory. Creating the solution requires an understanding of how the consumer data was processed and stored and how the communications with the customer would be managed, this made Elena to reach out to TCS for support due to the long term relationship.

Sourav Ghosh had over 11 years of experience with this client. He has gained contextual knowledge about client’s platforms, architecture and data processing, product strategy, payment scheme and their service lines enabled him to spear head this initiative. Sourav quickly realised that a straight injection of these accounts onto the target platform was not at all feasible. The exceptions and dispute transaction flows currently were being possessed in the source to be handled for continuity. The new card accounts on the target systems had to be issued on different payment schemes, thus demanding transaction mapping between the card accounts post the conversion. Sourav also had to consider porting the history of these card accounts onto the target platform for maintaining the cardholder history. Also, time zone differences are to be considered as the key personnel from both platforms for the required support.

Sourav’s expertise in the US platform enabled him to propose a unique solution wherein new accounts would be set up as replacements. Sourav and his team, had to consider mapping for the history databases as well as ensure that the US platform is able to pull the old data of the consumers as and when needed. This is to ensure that some of the processes within the target platform would require only minimal tweaks.
Sourav’s functional knowledge helped the team complete the mapping exercise, to create and test and the required conversion jobs on time. The icing-on-the-cake-touch was the approach note from him detailing how to successfully transfer the outstanding balances. This strategy on how to newly create cards to the consumers was highly appreciated by the bank. Sourav also helped the team create temporary processes to bridge the gap between the source and target platforms during the conversion/transition period.

With relentless efforts from Sourav and his team and dedicated work for eight months, the bank successfully converted all the card accounts from the Asia Pacific platform to the US platform. The conversion helped the bank to meet with legal, regulatory and compliance mandates and saved the cost of implementing changes in two different platforms. Total amount value of Portfolio that was converted was $70 MM. The Total Number of Customers who were impacted with this solution was 110 K. The result was better servicing at par with other US mainland customers, thus resulting in higher NPS for the bank.",Transformation Into Consistent And Efficient Processes,SHAROAN Mohammed,Cards,Regulatory & Compliance,Growth & Transformation,Item,1
"Emily worked for a prestigious North American Bank that had high-quality investment products and services to deliver. They were at a crossroads. Emily loved to solve puzzles, but this one took the cake. When deadlines were added to complicated problems, it only added pressure to the equation. There was a need for a fresh policy to govern the proper delivery of its investment products to individual investors. Also, the products had to be offered at a fair price with an appropriate return to them. This thought process led to the birth of delivery excellence with RDIP (Retail Distribution of Investment Products), a standardized framework for governance and investment product delivery.

Several challenges were anticipated at the beginning of the RDIP program. First of all, this policy had to be a bank-wide governance framework, which meant a high impact on the bank’s operations. To implement RDIP in its fullness, changes had to cut across the bank’s diverse systems and applications, which meant a high impact on the bank’s application landscape. Moreover, RDIP had to be implemented in multiple geographies in which the bank operates, which meant taking into account the nature of the systems, local policies, and regulations within the respective geographies, which meant a complex change scope. And there was an inevitable need to align with an aggressive timeline. So the bank looked up to TCS which was one of its most trusted partners for executing this program successfully, and M Ramchandar was given the mantle of program manager for the same.

M Ramchandar brought in the experience of executing multiple projects successfully with this client. During his time with them, he understood the complexities of the systems and how to be a gelling factor between diverse teams which had to operate in synergy to make RDIP work. His in-depth awareness of the client’s landscape and infrastructure was key to the solution.

Ramchandar was quick to realize that since multiple geographies were involved, there was a need to keep the applications across geographies in perfect sync. This meant that the change in one geography had to be meticulously tracked and rolled over to other geographies as well. Ramchandar’s familiarity with the client’s systems enabled him to realize that the system in each geography was different and hence it would not be a simple rollover. Systems in some geographies were fragile, and hence Ramchandar and his team had to enforce thorough regression to ensure no impact to Business As Usual. Also, the mode of project execution varied across geographies. Hence Ramchandar had to steer RDIP projects in Agile execution mode in some geographies whereas in the Waterfall mode of operation in some other geographies.

Ramchandar’s functional and process knowledge enabled him to counter all the above challenges. It acted as a bridge between diverse stakeholders including the business, end-users, the solution leads, the scrum masters, core application teams, interfaces, and testing teams. The result was the smooth execution of each of the RDIP projects. Moreover, Ramchandar’s familiarity with how each release operated enabled him to align (in conjunction with the respective solution leads) each and every RDIP changed to an appropriate release in accordance with the business expectations.

With consistent and channelized hard work over a marathon span of 2 years with unabated pace, Ramchandar and his team ensured that all critical business milestones were met through careful planning and execution, and as per the expected timelines. This allowed the bank to adhere to a standardized distribution of investment products to its consumer banking clients in the region. Also, the implementation of the policy enabled a higher level of suitability checks to be performed before the client purchased investment products.",Enabling Sound Return With A Fair Price,Mohit Goyal,Investment Banking,Regulatory & Compliance,Cost & Optimization,Item,1
"Eric headed the IT division in a leading auto Finance organization based in North America. Credit Reporting was important for an Auto-Finance Company. Eric frequently encountered issues with reporting inaccurate customer data and credit information to the Credit Reporting Agencies (CRAs). . The Primary reasons for the issues were outdated reporting rules, high complexity of the Mainframe Legacy applications, inappropriate Business Processes and Legacy system data issues.

Evolving State Regulations Changes in Business processes and Legacy System limitations resulted in inaccurate reporting of customer data to the CRAs. The client faced audit failures, penalties and Legal issues. Inconsistent and inaccurate reporting resulted in rejection by the CRAs. To overcome the situation, the client had to move the Credit Reporting functionality from Legacy systems to Business Intelligence (BI).

TCS was engaged with the client as a strategic partner for over 18 years. TCS participated in the Legacy Replacement initiative for migration, QA and remediation on impacted applications.

The Credit Reporting Remediation project had high visibility in the whole enterprise. However, the project failed due to Legacy data challenges, lack of as-is system knowledge and inappropriate approach by the project team. So the Client formed a new Joint Task Force (JTF) team with selected SMEs nominated by business and technology national managers to assess and resolve the situation.

Ritwik Chattopadhyay had over 11 years of experience working with TCS. He had an in-depth knowledge in Auto-lending practices, Application Landscape, Legacy Systems Data and Downstream. Ritwik had played a crucial role in successful implementation for multiple Legacy projects in the past. TCS brought in Ritwik to lead this assignment.

Even though the whole enterprise was following the waterfall model at that time, the JTF team started working in sprints following Agile methodology. With his clear understanding of the as-is system, Ritwik started documenting the as-is system logic in layman’s terms. He delivered a number of analysis documents and excel model calculations to the BI team which helped to mimic the as-is system logic in the new application. He proposed better calculation techniques to BI which helped accomplish complex logic in a simple way. Ritwik led an offshore team to perform detail system and data analysis. The offshore team under Ritwik’s leadership built a migration process for customer payment history profile data for the last 10 years.

The Credit Reporting project team previously faced challenges in mapping the data between Legacy system and BI. Ritwik pioneered the data mapping and the iterative discussions with the EDC team to resolve all the data issues for the new application. He led an initiative to create a source to target data mapping with documenting all the transformation logic in multiple levels in between.

Ritwik identified sample accounts from the as-is system for all the 150+ business scenarios so that the ongoing design approach could be continuously improved to handle all those different cases. He took an important role in explaining the system behavior while validating the test scenarios. During QA, his functional knowledge helped the team to close the defects with proper justifications. His proposals on processes like Bankruptcy, Business Customer Identification and Reporting Window Determination were appreciated and accepted by the JTF team and the client.

The client understood the value of as-is system knowledge while transforming a business process. They also saw the benefit of Agile practice for the first time through this project which allowed them to take a decision to transform fully from Waterfall to Agile within the next couple of years. The client achieved remarkable success through this project. These included streamlining of over 25 business processes, an improved accuracy yielding 90% reduction in rejects, a proactive identification of 30+ data issues, compliance with regulatory framework, enhanced quality control processes, increased customer satisfaction and accurate credit reporting of 5+ Million portfolios.

"Eric was the Enterprise support manager of an auto-financing loan company that dealt with huge chunks of data by building and maintaining large data warehouse applications. Of late, Eric was plagued with a particular issue that impacted the deliverables. Every morning the ETL application faced connectivity issues, and users couldn’t connect to their non- production environments. The problem had started around March 2020 and continued for a few weeks. The application developers, testers, and business users were impacted as the ETL application was unavailable for almost two hours in a day. Consequently, daily productivity was affected, and the deliverables were delayed.

The issue had impacted more than twenty developers and testers offshore. Hence, they worked over the weekends to avoid further schedule slippages. Also, the issue became the highlight of the daily scrum calls. Despite a temporary solution, the leadership team was looking for a permanent solution.

Eric reached out to TCS offshore team as the issue mostly occurred during the offshore working hours. Soon the TCS management assigned Aarthi for the task. She was the Offshore application support team Lead. Moreover, Aarthi had been working closely with Eric for more than two years. Thus, she had good contextual knowledge about the client’s on ETL/BI application support activities. Also, she had more than ten years of experience in ETL/BI and Hadoop applications.

Aarthi had gauged the criticality of the problem and soon began with the investigation. As a first step, Aarthi, along with her team, thoroughly studied the ETL application and its server logs. From the logs, they identified that during a specific time interval, the database where the application’s metadata repository was placed refused its connection to the application. Consequently, it became unavailable to users.

As a next step, Aarthi’s team reached out to the DBA team, but they could not trace any downtime in their database logs. The support team then went further and requested the network team to set up a network trace for that specified time interval. From the network trace, it was identified that the repository’s database server went down during that period.

With the network trace, Aarthi and her team had reached out to the System Admin team. They confirmed that the server went down after completing its daily VM backup. Finally, Aarthi undertook a further investigation and ensured that the server would be online and there won’t be similar issues in the future. Subsequently, the TCS team closely monitored the application for a few more days to ensure that no downtime was reported.

The result of the solution was such that the developers and the testers who had raised the issue did not face any further issues, and they could deliver on time.

The client was delighted as a permanent solution for the issue was identified.

The support team then went further and requested the network team to set up a network trace for that specified time interval. From the network trace, it was identified that the repository’s database server went down during that period.

With the network trace, Aarthi and her team had reached out to the System Admin team. They confirmed that the server went down after completing its daily VM backup. Finally, Aarthi undertook a further investigation and ensured that the server would be online and there won’t be similar issues in the future. Subsequently, the TCS team closely monitored the application for a few more days to ensure that no downtime was reported.

The result of the solution was such that the developers and the testers who had raised the issue did not face any further issues, and they could deliver on time.

The client was delighted as a permanent solution for the issue was identified. Numerous accolades were sent for Aarthi and her team, while TCS continued its rewarding journey with the client.",Etl Application Down Time Elimination,SHAROAN Mohammed,Automative Finance,Technology Infrastructure,Cost & Optimization,Item,3
"Evan was the Operations Manager of the largest captive auto finance company in North America. The company serviced more than 4 million active customers in its loan and lease portfolio. They also provided ancillary insurance products as part of their offerings. Moreover, daily, around 7-8K new customers were onboarded into the system. But Evan was perturbed with the entire fund collection process from the delinquent customers. A big part of the company’s business involved collecting funds from delinquent customers. The auto finance company had a collections and recovery management system to do so.

The customers were put into active collections after they remained delinquent for more than ten days. A delinquent customer got calls from automatic dialers to make payments. In case the customer did not pay, then collection letters were sent out. If the customer still did not pay, then the appropriate recovery management process was initiated, which might lead to charge off and eventual repossession and auction of the vehicle.

However, Evan thought it would be a better idea to collect funds from customers before moving into active collections. Hence, they wanted to optimize costs and drive up Collection activity. Thus, a new business model was conceptualized for sending ‘Proactive Notifications’ to the customer who had become delinquent. TCS was roped in to find a technology solution for this new business process because they were partners with the company for more than seventeen years. Dipanjan Ghosh from TCS was chosen to lead the initiative. He had been associated with the same client for more than fourteen years. Therefore, he had enough contextual knowledge about the client’s end-to-end business process, the various applications, and how they interacted.

The solution was created by leveraging the Salesforce Marketing Cloud product. The solution was such that if the customer opted out of future text messages, the customer's future communication preference had to be updated on a real-time basis across multiple systems. The phone numbers for eligible customers who were supposed to get a text on a particular day were scrubbed using a third-party phone number scrubbing system. It was done to ensure that the wrong phone number did not get the text message. Additionally, the customer was also given the option of making a payment using a link provided along with the ‘Payment Reminder Text.’ The customers could also authenticate the last four digits of SSN and make a payment from their handheld device.

Numerous challenges cropped up during the testing phase of the project. But Dipanjan used his contextual knowledge of the client’s ecosystem to devise a robust solution. The implementation of the pilot project for California proved to be a huge success. Fewer customers moved into active collections when payments were made. It helped in reducing the agent workload to do follow-ups with the customer for making a payment. Finally, when the program was rolled out to the entire USA, the client could realize an effort-saving of 8 FTE from a collection agent perspective. The credit loss percentage had reduced by 8-10% in the last two years. Moreover, the client could recover around 50M yearly from delinquent customers.

"Every time the financial services holding company leading in mergers and acquisitions made systems conversions and migrations as part of such deals, it faced a huge challenge: Transfer of data with fidelity. Errors in data arose commonly during these migrations either owing to invalid data or the lack of data visualisation. Dante Howard, the operations head of the company, decided that a solution was essential to prevent recurrence of the problem and picked TCS to deliver a solution.

The consultancy was to fix issues with data verification and validation. The challenge was steep given that the migrations were time-sensitive; mergers and acquisitions are meant to increase market share and positioning of companies and to give them broader market access. Such purchase deals are time-bound and breach of deadline would lead to huge penalties and loss of reputation for companies. It was, therefore, essential for the company to complete data transfer to target systems within time to ensure business readiness.




Dinesh understood the challenge well and used his in-depth understanding of the company’s business and processes, gained over his association with the firm for 10 years, to develop a solution. He knew the multiple gaps and inadequacies in data, and programs and modules underlying the application. He introduced data checks and dashboards for remediation of data and conversion. The dashboard provided the business users a view of the migrated data and the percentage of data accuracy, which, along with data checks, ensured seamless data migration and validation.

The client had earlier never used any data visualization solution, which resulted in reconciliation of data manually and a lack of holistic view of data migrated. Dinesh employed reusable components in the design and focused on preventing entry of invalid/incorrect data. The dashboard he envisaged provided a consolidated view of the discrepancies in the data that was being migrated. This also enabled them to quickly focus on problem areas as and when the dashboard showed them real-time information on problems with data being migrated.

Manual intervention required in writing separate scripts saved users a lot of time. Once the data checks and dashboards Dinesh and team built were implemented across all systems of the company at different subdivisions of the organisation, it gave the support teams of the company a holistic view of the data migrated. This, in turn, reduced the number of data failure incidents and improved issue detection and remediation during data migration.

The solution remediated approximately 90 percent of all the data errors and the timely intervention enabled seamless data migration and validation.

"For any customer, ATM is a simple concept. You pop in your card, punch in your pin, and the magic machine spits out your cash, it's as simple as that and provides an unforgettable experience. Therefore, with the advent of technology, all banks are trying hard to produce a more sophisticated and updated version of automated teller machines (ATM). The client of TCS, an American multinational investment bank and financial services corporation had a similar plan in mind. They were facing many problems in the ATM domain that required to be addressed immediately. These include implementing a process to bring down ATM reboot and enabling Pinless Payment for Credit Card in ATM to attract more customers. The user requested amount had to be dispensed, based on the bill mix algorithm with available denomination bills in ATM. In all, an improved ATM package had to be rolled out to increase the success rate in production. The management knew that if the four pain areas mentioned above were not resolved immediately, it would impact business severely and end customers may switch to other banks.

Being associated for a long time, TCS was keen to showcase their client commitment capabilities and prevent financial and reputational loss to the bank. As a Development and Product support head, TCSer Ravi Rajgopal had in-depth expertise, ATM domain knowledge and was familiar with the client's infrastructure. Thanks to his contextual understanding of the client organization and environment, he was able to address the pain areas in a defined manner. Ravi brought out the best practices, conducted brainstorming sessions, created POC and adopted agile concepts to resolve their issues accurately.

Ravi adopted the Agile methodology and addressed one issue at a time. As an ATM Reboot trend, he implemented a process to achieve the ""Get to Green"" state. For that, Ravi identified major contributors with daily tracking, analyzed and assigned to respective teams, performed Patch Release in intervals and followed up on the fixed Reboots. Ravi initiated POC for Credit Card Pinless Payment and Custom Withdrawal Denomination Selection to successfully implement these features. To achieve a 99% success rate in production rollout, Ravi defined a process in each SDLC phase.

Post-implementation, the client appreciated Ravi's efforts because they were able to see tremendous business growth. A green initiative improved its brand image, and an additional 18% of end customers were seen using Pinless Payment functionality in ATM. Custom Withdrawal Denomination Selection process was implemented, and the business was able to see the usage of this flow in an upward trend. The demo of the solution was given to all stakeholders. Ravi received very impressive feedback from them, and the client decided to implement it in other regions. He also received appreciation from Client – ATM director during the recent visit to India. This further strengthened TCS's relationship with the client paving the way for future engagements.",Developing Innovative Solutions In The Atm Domain To Enhance Customer Experience ,Rajagopal Pandian,Investment Banking,Process optimization,Growth & Transformation,Item,1
"For five years now, Bjorn, the CIO of a global financial corporation based in the US, watched the slow but steady uptick in the number of incidents related to the monitoring of applications/production servers, scheduled jobs and service requests from end users. This steep rise, had begun causing delays and SLA misses, which were beginning to severely impact the customer base. As a corollary, it was also denting the reputation of TCS, which provided production support across multiple Lines of Business and had been a strategic partner for more than a decade.

What concerned the consultancy was the reasons for these problems. Primary among them was the lack of a knowledge base, on account of the absence of SMEs, which led to delays in repetitive issues, and time for resolution. Then there was the matter of dependencies between applications, details of which were not readily available with the support team. Manual effort, dearth of innovation and insufficiency in readiness assessment were all part of the problem.


With its reputation on the line, TCS brought in associate Nitesh Kumar, who had been with the client for eight years and had gained a deep contextual knowledge of their culture, and business. He knew the gaps and inadequacies in the application knowledge, manual health activity and manual tasks being executed and was gifted with the knack of assessing the environment in which the client worked, the pain areas and goals, and was credited with prudent decision-making skills.

Even for him though, it would be a challenge to align different client domains into one support model framework. Breaking the problem down into smaller parts, Nitesh laid down procedures to narrow down the knowledge gaps. Through knowledge sharing, he trained and identified SMEs, which helped business users and resulted in problems getting solved swiftly and effectively. He also created a platform where all issues, and their remedies could be documented, seeding the process of constant learning for all stakeholders and users. Nitesh’s deep contextual knowledge allowed him to automate many daily tasks, reducing human effort and error. Combined, he set the pace for quick and correct decision-making by making it part of regular practice, thereby saving 30 hours of manual activity and reducing human error by 95 percent.

"For the second time in as many months, Morris Wright, a Chief Technical Officer with a US-based Fortune 50 bank, received an internal audit alert on rising costs.

Analyses showed that mainframe operating costs had spiked from the previous quarters. Morris’s team reported that mainframe MIPS usage was causing the rise. The bank’s user interface system required redesign to bring MIPS usage down. But its design was so complex that only a few experts knew how it worked. This made MIPS usage optimization a nearly insurmountable challenge within the available time and budget. The team also had to find a means to prevent service disruption during the redesign. The task called for external support for cost effective implementation within timeframe.

Morris knew TCS could deliver the solution within the constraints as the consultancy had a good track record throughout its association of more than a decade with the bank. TCS was roped in and Associate Satheeshkumar Nataraj handed the project. He had worked on the bank’s interface for 12 years and was a subject matter expert. Over three months, Satheeshkumar analyzed multiple factors, including the number of shadow calls being made from the driver programs, redundant intra-region linking for fetching customer score information, and reports that detailed spikes in MIPS consumptions.

He then looked at how MIPS usage could be optimized by changing connection parameters and redesigning to avoid multiple hops. He remodeled the score-fetching calls. Satheeshkumar detailed how various cards sub-systems were using the customer’s score information and its contribution to CPU usage. The TCS associate could also figure out how this data would be used and when, thereby enabling him to suggest modifications that improved the processing time of the interface system.

Functional knowledge helped Satheeshkumar notice that the connection parameters between mainframe environments were being used inefficiently and contributing to a large portion of the CPU time. These parameters were redesigned to ensure CPU time was optimized within the host interface system.

The tweaks that the TCS associate introduced cut response time significantly for front-end users. The remodelled host interface system also removed up to 12 million shadow calls from the mainframe driver programs. This resulted in savings of $1 million, which was well appreciated and called out by the bank. The project added to expertise in mainframe optimization programs and helped TCS establish leadership in this space.",Redesigned Interface To Contain Operational Costs,SHAROAN Mohammed,Cards,Process optimization,Cost & Optimization,Item,2
"Fraud issues are a critical thorn in any bank's throat and this is why every financial institution strives to identify and fix them at the earliest. This bank was no different too, and Dan* was appointed as the Head of Fraud Mitigation. His role was to identify past frauds, their reasons, take the necessary actions to fix them, and avoid the possibility of such frauds in the future.

He analyzed the records and identified a connectivity issue in September 2017 that excluded around 140,000 applications across Branded and Retail card LOBs from a mandatory internal check process. This had opened up vulnerabilities and Dan decided to evaluate applications that were converted to open accounts during the affected period which had Suspect Database hits. This was important as delays in remediation would directly affect the company's revenue and increase the probability of bad credit and operational follow-ups.

Dan knew that this was not possible without technical assistance and he approached the management for a solution. In turn, the management decided to outsource it to TCS as it was the company's primary development partner.

Vinayak was allocated for this project as he had been with this client since 2010. Over the years, he had gained a comprehensive understanding of the banking terms, processes, and functional flows. He was working as a technical lead when this issue surfaced. As he had prior experience with the suspect check functionality, he was asked to look into it.


After a quick analysis, he came up with a multi-pronged approach. With his contextual knowledge, he knew that deployment on production servers would not allow execution control and non-prod servers would be access-restricted, so he decided to run the process directly from his local machine. Next, he decided to execute the processes in small batches to work within the RAM/processing restrictions. Also, he knew that the process would have to run outside of regular business hours to prevent any impact on database performance.

With the above considerations in mind, he designed and developed a custom process that enhanced the existing functionality into a stand-alone solution. This process took the application-IDs as input and fetched relevant data from production databases. He recreated the suspect check functionality with additional checks and logic to generate a spreadsheet-like output and tabulated the suspect cases and their corresponding matched keys. Further, he adjusted the performance parameters to ensure a smooth operation. After multiple iterations, tests in the lower regions, and reviews with the BA and compliance team over report layout – it was time for implementation.

The overall execution lasted a few days – late nights and steady iterative work was the need of the hour! Regular validation, monitoring, self-assigned checkpoints, ramped-up batch sizes, and regular backups were required to ensure that everything stayed on track. And all these efforts paid off as it filtered the true suspect accounts, undoubtedly leading to reduced credit risk and direct dollar savings. He was well-appreciated and this was the beginning of an overhaul of the suspect check functionality. From redefined logic, restructured databases, and redesigned code - TCS was engaged at all stages leading to more projects, increased knowledge, greater trust, and a closer working relationship with the client.",Identifying Potential Fraud Cases,"M, Mr. KARTHEKEYAN (Karthekeyan)",Cards,Regulatory & Compliance,Growth & Transformation,Item,1

Regular validation, monitoring, self-assigned checkpoints, ramped-up batch sizes, and regular backups were required to ensure that everything stayed on track. And all these efforts paid off as it filtered the true suspect accounts, undoubtedly leading to reduced credit risk and direct dollar savings. He was well-appreciated and this was the beginning of an overhaul of the suspect check functionality. From redefined logic, restructured databases, and redesigned code - TCS was engaged at all stages leading to more projects, increased knowledge, greater trust, and a closer working relationship with the client.",Identifying Potential Fraud Cases,SHAROAN Mohammed,Cards,Regulatory & Compliance,Growth & Transformation,Item,2
"Gavin has been the Manager of a team for a leading global Bank with its presence all over the world. His team worked on an application that was used by at least 15,000 users every day. The primary responsibility of Gavin’s team was to convert the transaction details as either save/download as PDF for future reference. The pdf conversion was done using an old architecture that took a very long time and was not compatible with debugging issues quickly.

Applying changes to the PDF took a long time and the requirement for enhancement was often, leading to high development time with the main challenge being the high usage of the application. To restructure the code and to change the existing architecture was time-consuming. The day-to-day increase in the usage and no. of changes required, made the feature more demanding to be developed/enhanced as the code changes were time-consuming and were not maintainable.

Gavin saw the need to bring in TCS to find a solution. Sukanya Mondal was assigned to the project as she has already been associated with the bank working on different applications with different architecture. Having gained experience working in the banking domain/Java/JEE for a long time helped Sukanya understand the requirement and architecture.

Making changes to an existing functionality was challenging in both development and testing. To test all the pdf related functionalities and to ensure data integrity was time-consuming. Since she had worked on the application for a year, she developed the idea for the new architecture that could be of less maintenance and less response time.

Being the only resource allocated to execute the changes, it was difficult for Sukanya to decide on the new architecture. With the technical and domain knowledge gained over the 7-8 of experience and with the help of a few articles on design patterns, she was able to develop the new architecture.

Using TCS’s mandate Agile methodology, Sukanya divided the project into stories and tested the features rigorously in sprints. The changes were then deployed into the production and found to be compatible with the business testers as they could convert the PDfs in no time. Sukanya also made the PDF conversion compatible for a developer to make changes within a few minutes that took almost a day, otherwise.

Gavin applauded Sukanya and TCS for making the PDF conversion easier as the enhanced PDF conversion process increased the teams’ utilization. He went on to appreciate the idea of making the PDF conversion compatible for the developers reducing the turnaround time drastically.",Enhancing The Pdf Conversion With A New Architecture To Increase Utilization By The Team,SENTHIL Shiyalam,Commercial Banking,Process optimization,Cost & Optimization,Item,1
"Giridhar and Madhav were working as the IT Project Manager and Client Service Manager respectively for one of the largest Brazilian based re-insurance companies. Both Giridhar and Madhav felt the need of revamping/upgrading their quality team to alleviate the existing quality issues. They wanted their quality team to be the quality guardians for all their releases and accelerate their time to market. Their inverted defect pyramid detected the leakage rate to be more than 50%. The no. of defects detected by an ideal pyramid would be more during the initial phase (unit and integration phase) and minimal/nil defects during the acceptance phase. The existing testing phases lacked the entry and exit criteria between the testing phases and the test coverage always resulted below optimum.
The company’s Business analysts spent very minimal time in backlog refinement and requirement clarifications, adding to the agony. The discrepancies affected the end quality and business deliverables required 20 hours for rework and 60 hours for business acceptance testing during the Sprint.

Giridhar and Madhav, both approached Pratick Choudhary of TCS for a solution. Pratick was a part of the solutioning team for LATAM BFSI clients of TCS for about 3 years. Giridhar and Madhav laid out their challenges and requirements for Pratick’s analysis. Pratick had several brainstorming sessions with the TCS team to come up with a macro view of the testing process. Pooling in the talents and thoughts of his team, Pratick prepared a value stream map of the entire testing process to record the value-added, non-value added and value enabling activities. After the root causes of all these activities were identified, he prepared an impact-control matrix to determine the medium, high and out of control impacts of the root causes.

Pratick then formulated solutions like requirement testing, test case prioritization, elimination of business acceptance testing, automation test case generation, peer review and weekly review of all PROD incidents. The best solution was finalized considering the five most important factors, complexity, budget, time to implement, effectiveness and minimal intrusion. Pratick then presented the solution to Giridhar and Madhav who appreciated and approved the implementation.

"Gone were the days where it was safe to send confidential information via paper-based postal letters. Everything has gone digital to be on the safe side as well as exceptionally reduce the costs involved too.

The client had a separate division called the Letters team that processed around 10K Adverse Action paper communications per day to customers via USPS and the costs for consumables and logistics were quite considerable. Around September 2019, the client undertook an initiative to move these communications digitally for those customers who agreed and signed up for it.

As part of the legal requirements and compliance, the letter content cannot be just sent directly as emails. There were 8 different letter content to be sent out to customers communicating about credit card application decision status. These letters needed to be an encrypted password-protected content attached to a cover email. The email communications had to adhere to the ADA standards. The bigger challenge the client did not foresee was the volume limitations the email rendering vendor had before supporting the full volume during the warranty period.

This challenge had to be addressed at the soonest and the client turned to TCS for help. As part of iCAPs, this functionality needed implementation and validation before the end of 2019. Arun Isaac, the experienced developer from TCS was tasked to solve this issue. Banking on his experience and contextual knowledge Arun analyzed the problem in detail. His in-depth technical knowledge in the system, Exstream application, data flow, in letters batch and email processes helped him to put together a solution approach and present it to clients.



Arun analyzed DCF batch and email processes, password requirements and designed a solution to source the input feed from CI/CDE, process the content as a cover email, attaching the actual letter content as a password protected pdf attachment. His vast knowledge in batch processing and Exstream application helped him narrow down on the optimal solution for the requirement. An end to end reconciliation process was also set up to take care of emails that did not get delivered to customers along with a streamlined bounce back mechanism is built for such communications.

On successful completion of UAT end to end validation of the new functionality, the client was impressed and agreed to install the changes to production systems. It helped to reduce 90% of the paper volume of Adverse Action letters and got them delivered as emails. Having rolled out this initiative smoothly and having gained more than desirable benefits from this the client realized a lot of cost savings for the same.

Customers who consented for digital communications were now receiving Adverse Action communications in their email address digitally instead of the physical printed letter. It was indeed a watershed moment for both TCS and the client.",Moving Mail To Email One Credit Card At A Time,SHAROAN Mohammed,Cards,Regulatory & Compliance,Growth & Transformation,Item,1
"Gregory, the CTO of a leading US-based bank was caught between a rock and a hard place during the busiest season of the year in 2013 as the backend card decision system that supports all the sale transaction decision processes across the clientele was down for 15 minutes. There was dissatisfaction all around, especially because all the new sale requests that were coming into the system were getting rejected, causing loss of revenue. New accounts were not getting booked in the system, causing issues with potential future sales. Even though 15 minutes seemed a very less time, it was enough to affect almost 10,000 transactions which led to a revenue drop of 250,000.

This had got Gregory worried and he knew that he couldn’t let this continue. So, he immediately prepared for damage control and his first step was to look for external vendors who could help him and his team in damage control and fix the problems. After several considerations, Gregory decided to work with TCS, one of the most trusted external vendors of the bank since 2004. Gregory quickly arranged for a meeting with TCS and explained the challenges and requirements to the team. The challenges were to avoid direct loss of revenue and regain the retail clientele’s confidence. The requirement was to build a robust decision system that could handle downtime and provide seamless transaction processing for all clientele and also help in avoiding any potential loss of revenue.

Like always, team TCS accepted the project and handed it over to the man they thought could take care of it in the best possible way – Vinod Harihara Subramanian. Vinod, a TCS employee, had been working with the client for almost 7 years across offshore and onsite locations and it had helped him gain in-depth knowledge of the client’s business, IT landscape, environment topography, and the surround systems. Besides, he also had technical knowledge of Microsoft technologies and system frameworks, which would be an added bonus. With his knowledge and experience, Vinod came up with a solution to handle all rejected sale requests from the backend decision system.

Vinod and the team analyzed and understood the various surround systems in the client’s retail business and handpicked the system that could provide the data needed for the decision process. Finally, after overcoming all challenges, the team developed an “AuthStandIn - An In-house Decision Engine” that could process the sale transactions that were getting systematically rejected by the backend decision system. Vinod’s knowledge about the surround systems helped him to pick the correct source of information and his expertise with the existing decision algorithm steered him to make this solution a viable one to handle the requirements of the wide clientele that the bank serves.

The solution was built robustly but it had the option of customization to suit the requirements of all the individual retail clients using a simple ruleset. Gregory was happy with the solution since it not only addressed the rejects due to backend system unavailability but also provided a mechanism to decide the rejects due to insufficient information. The implementation resulted in zero rejects and incremental revenue, which was highly appreciated by Gregory and his associates. All of them thanked Vinod and his team for the excellent work and hoped to work together in the future too.",Robust Inhouse System For Augmented Revenue Customer Satisfaction,N.

"Hana was a senior business manager of a large captive auto finance company in the US. Of late, she had lost the zeal to go to work because most of her workday was taken up by manually scrutinizing, approving and printing checks. This was an issue faced by this US-based auto finance company. Almost all the outgoing transactions of the client were processed through a legacy based check processing application through two levels of manual authorization and printing done by the business users.

The result was that every month around 40000-50000 checks were manually scrutinized, approved and printed by a handful of business managers and authorized users, and the process took a majority of their productive time. Moreover, the higher check processing time also caused a delay in disbursement.

The stakeholders of the organization decided to seek help from TCS because they had spent quite some time with the client as part of the enhancement and support team of the legacy system. Somshekhar Das from TCS was chosen to lead the initiative and help the client come out of this bottleneck. Somshekhar was part of the development and support team of TCS across multiple applications of the client. He had also worked as an SME for techno-functional solutions along with project management. Therefore, he had extensive contextual knowledge about the client’s critical inherent functional need, their legacy applications, and process gaps. Besides, he had worked on multiple business proposals and had provided innovative solutions and streamlined production support processes.

Somshekhar began with a detailed analysis to understand the problem better. He found that approximately 80% of the checks were system generated loan and lease overpayment disbursement, and almost 75% of them were of an insignificant amount (below $20) with respect to cost incurred. It meant that 60% of the process could be automated without any in-depth manual review process.

Somshekhar designed a phased automated process for application enhancement and proposed it to the client. As per the design, the batch process, which was sending customer overpayment data from the up-stream core system of loan and lease would automatically trigger the new process in check processing application to generate system approved checks. In the next phase, the automated process was extended to send the approved checks automatically to printers across locations. And in the final phase, the check printing process was outsourced to a third-party organization to reduce the upkeep and recurring cost of the specialized check printer server services.

The benefits of the solution were huge. It saved the substantial time and effort of the business managers. The figure was equal to three hundred hours of manual effort per month, which they could devote towards other critical responsibilities. Besides, the end to end check processing delay was reduced from days to minutes, the delay in the disbursement was eliminated, which in turn improved customer satisfaction and there was a reduced maintenance cost due to the outsourcing of the physical printing process.

"Harry* had recently taken over as the head of the Enterprise Data Services (EDS) department of a leading North American auto finance company. As a first step, he wanted to understand its daily operations, processes and systems that were in place. He requested reports from different managers about their respective teams and the role they played within the EDS department. This department handled data quality, ETL, and business intelligence; it had come into existence in 2008, so Harry assumed that it to be a piece of cake to get a grasp of its operations. Little did he realize how wrong he was!

With the reports that came in, Harry tried to get a complete picture of the department's operations. Soon, it was the end of the month and Harry didn't get the monthly performance data that he wanted. In fact, with the existing reports, he was unable to get a good grasp of the operations. A deeper probe showed that there weren't many processes in place to check the quality of EDS data; there also were no strict controls in profiles execution monitoring, tracking key data elements change, technical data lineage and reporting. After having a word with the managers, Harry took it up with the management and explained to them the problem. Further analysis showed that there was a hidden negative impact on the data warehouse performance which was hitherto not identified, and a red alert came up for data lineage as part of data governance. All these led the management to immediately explore a solution, and it turned to TCS for help.

TCS had been associated with the client since February 2011 and it assigned Sivasubrahmanian (known fondly as ""Siva"") Durai for this project because he was an expert in data warehouse tools and technologies. He also had a good understanding of the existing processes and systems, and putting it all together, he was able to quickly identify the client's pain points. He had direct meetings with Harry and other top stakeholders; based on it, he designed a scalable framework that addressed these issues without impacting operations.

"Harry* was extremely disappointed as he could not buy that watch for Paula*, his friend. The reason was he did not have cash, and his credit card did not work. He immediately called up his bank, and they apologised to him for the inconvenience caused. Harry was not the only customer, but there were many others like Harry, whose credit card transactions failed. The bank was receiving numerous such complaints daily. This was the case of a fraud identification department of a global bank. The reason was that they had deployed multiple agents to review the fraud transactions and take necessary actions against the accounts. The time taken for each review varied between 5 to 30 minutes. The number of transactions processed in a day was less than expected, and it created a backlog.

To come out of this bottleneck, the bank approached TCS. Vijayakumar Venkatachalam has been working with the client on credit card collections and solutions area for more than twelve years. In the past, he worked closely with the client’s business team and had provided multiple rule engine based utility solutions. This improved the client’s NPS (Net Promoter Score) and had brought about process simplification.

Vijayakumar was the delivery manager and SME in operations and digitisation area. He had proficiency in automation solutions to business. The solution proposed for this particular problem involved the analysis of various tools in the market and the identification of the right tool for providing a better solution to the customer. He brought on board a team member experienced in the field of data science and automation to arrive at the solution.

Vijayakumar and Team developed a Machine Learning (ML) based solution for the problem, which could perform the classification of notes and implement the entire architecture by leveraging the existing application instead of adding more cost to the customer. This involved introducing automation techniques in fraud operations to augment agent capabilities and replace the current manual steps for reviewing notes and researching through applicable third party data providers to produce risk indicators. Also, the Tensor Flow-based solution provided more than ninety-nine percentage of accuracy. Such an achievement impressed the client, and they wanted to make it live.

The programme manager from the fraud operations team was delighted with the new implementation. All the solutions that Vijayakumar and his team had offered like Google Tensorflow, the API, and the direct data pull methodology worked well for the client. Subsequently, the Fraud Banking group projected savings of around $1.4 Million for the year 2019. Vijayakumar and TCS received accolades from business teams. Besides, the ML solution was shared with other clients, and TCS bagged new contracts to implement similar solutions in APAC, Mexico and other regions having identical use cases.",Stateoftheart Automation Solution For Fraud Detection,"M, Mr. KARTHEKEYAN (Karthekeyan)",Cards,Artificial Intelligence,Cost & Optimization,Item,2

He brought on board a team member experienced in the field of data science and automation to arrive at the solution.

Vijayakumar and Team developed a Machine Learning (ML) based solution for the problem, which could perform the classification of notes and implement the entire architecture by leveraging the existing application instead of adding more cost to the customer. This involved introducing automation techniques in fraud operations to augment agent capabilities and replace the current manual steps for reviewing notes and researching through applicable third party data providers to produce risk indicators. Also, the Tensor Flow-based solution provided more than ninety-nine percentage of accuracy. Such an achievement impressed the client, and they wanted to make it live.

The programme manager from the fraud operations team was delighted with the new implementation. All the solutions that Vijayakumar and his team had offered like Google Tensorflow, the API, and the direct data pull methodology worked well for the client. Subsequently, the Fraud Banking group projected savings of around $1.4 Million for the year 2019. Vijayakumar and TCS received accolades from business teams. Besides, the ML solution was shared with other clients, and TCS bagged new contracts to implement similar solutions in APAC, Mexico and other regions having identical use cases.",Stateoftheart Automation Solution For Fraud Detection,SHAROAN Mohammed,Cards,Artificial Intelligence,Cost & Optimization,Item,1
"Harry* was extremely disappointed as he could not buy that watch for Paula*, his friend. The reason was he did not have cash, and his credit card did not work. He immediately called up his bank, and they apologised to him for the inconvenience caused. Harry was not the only customer, but there were many others like Harry, whose credit card transactions failed. The bank was receiving numerous such complaints daily. This was the case of a fraud identification department of a global bank. The reason was that they had deployed multiple agents to review the fraud transactions and take necessary actions against the accounts. The time taken for each review varied between 5 to 30 minutes. The number of transactions processed in a day was less than expected, and it created a backlog.

To come out of this bottleneck, the bank approached TCS. Vijayakumar Venkatachalam has been working with the client on credit card collections and solutions area for more than twelve years. In the past, he worked closely with the client’s business team and had provided multiple rule engine based utility solutions. This improved the client’s NPS (Net Promoter Score) and had brought about process simplification.

"Henry O’Neil was enjoying his weekend playing his favourite sport Golf when he got a call to join the bridge. Henry was one of the Directors of a leading bank in the USA. The conference call was convened by the top management to discuss an initiative to enhance their Customer Billed Transaction History for both Consumer accounts and Business card accounts to 24 months (24 MBH). Currently, the consumer accounts had only 6 months of Customer Billed Transaction History (6 MBH) whereas the business card accounts had 12 months of Customer Billed Transaction History (12 MBH).

The management was convinced that expanding to 24 MBH would provide consistency across Customer Service, Collections, Fraud and Internet Channels. The strategy would also put the bank on par with their competitors, provide more flexibility to business and enable the best searching capabilities for end customers. Henry was identified as the right person to drive the initiative. Henry was looking for an IT partner who would provide the right tools and technologies to achieve the goal.

The client, a leading bank in the US, wanted to replace their current Annual Account Summary (AAS) provided by Mainframes applications through VSAM (Virtual Storage Access Method). Since this involved a huge MIPS consumption, it had a direct revenue impact for the client. Hence Henry wanted to leverage the digital channels for providing the 24 MBH transaction functionality. Henry faced few challenges like identifying the right tools and technologies for application performance, integrate different lines of business into the solution and high system availability for business continuity. Additionally, the solution was also required to reduce the number of customer calls to the call centre for their transaction history details.

With various challenges to handle, Henry decided to approach TCS who was already providing IT services to the client. TCS accepted the challenge and made Dorababu B V R as the Contextual Master (CM) for the task. Dorababu had been associated with the client for 11 years working for Customer Service, Collections, IVR, Internet Channels and Retails Services. During his long association with the client, he had acquired a rich knowledge on the client’s business processes, middleware technologies, requirements and banking domain.

Dorababu’s contextual knowledge helped him to understand that the need of the hour was business process optimization enabled by IT services and robust architecture. With his technology expertise, he was able to identify the right technology to provide a high performance. Leveraging his understanding of the client’s legacy applications and new technologies, he proposed an end-to-end solution architecture to provide 24 MBH transaction services. The architecture helped to customize the transaction search processing to meet all the front-end channel requirements. The architectural design also provided a ‘go-to-market’ process which differentiated the client from other banks and helped to increase the customer base.

Dorababu collaborated with different TCS expert teams to build a POC and a demo was given to the client teams. On the client’s approval, Dorababu along with other TCS teams successfully implemented the architectural solution.

The solution implemented by Dorababu along with other TCS teams helped the client to have a 24 MBH transaction processing in place. The solution provided for a scalable model and high availability of the system across all front-end channels for transaction services. The solution helped to reduce the number of customer calls to the client’s call centre for their transaction history details. As a result, the call centre personnel were able to focus on other activities. The solution was implemented in a seamless manner and it was BAU for the end customers.

The client was able to improve its customer base due to improved customer experience. The client management immensely praised Dorababu and other TCS teams for their enduring commitment to providing a quality solution.",Robust Architecture To Enable Enhanced Customer Billed Transaction History,SHAROAN Mohammed,Cards,Digital Transformation,Growth & Transformation,Item,1
"In 2015, a leading financial company had embarked the journey of digital transformation. While doing so, they had replaced their mainframe-based recovery management systems with products. Later, in 2017, they started shifting their HQ from Torrance, CA to Plano, TX. Everything was going as per plan. But, not for long. The year 2018 turned out to be miserable for John. He was the CTO of the company. After the first release of their recovery management product, a significant data gap was found between the as-is and to-be applications. As a result, John came under a lot of pressure from the Board of Directors (BOD) to find the root cause. He decided to set up an internal investigation team to find facts for corrective actions. The team performed its analysis and presented the report in front of the BOD. It was mentioned that the new product had major data issues. Also, the downstream and upstream integrations were not strategised as there was no one with as-is business knowledge in the existing development team.

To resolve the above problem and to roll out the product within three months, John knew that it was crucial to revisit their migration and integration strategy. If the rollout was not done on time, then they would have to pay $1.5 million to renew the as-is vendor application certificate. TCS was their IT strategic partner for the last eighteen years. They were already managing the majority of applications, including the mainframe legacy applications. Hence, John approached TCS to help him with the problem.

Upon understanding the task, Purnendu Das was roped in as a contextual master to drive the project. This is because he was associated with the client for the past nine years and had in-depth knowledge in their auto lending practices and application landscape. Besides, he was the subject matter expert in the Auto finance domain. Purnendu had been actively playing a consultant role to assist the business units in understanding their pain areas, solving problems, and generating business value. He was also managing legacy collections and recovery applications from an operational standpoint and leading changes that were essential to run the business. With the help of this acquired contextual knowledge, Purnendu was able to explain the gaps between as-is processes and to-be business process maps and implement the solution successfully.

With the help of process and activity mapping, Purnendu explained the content meaning of data and how they were different in the new product. This helped the stakeholders to understand the gaps in product readiness. Next, he created the migration strategy for phase-2 rollout and corrected some major integrations with upstream applications which resulted in the data error in the new product. Later, Purnendu took the help of the legacy TCS team to document the as-is structural and content meaning of data with associated logic. This helped to rationalise, create data catalogues and then map the as-is data with the to-be processes to identify the data gaps by performing the data comparison exercise.

With the help of the as-is system flow knowledge, Purnendu identified the data integration gaps and modified the architecture by resolving those gaps. Finally, he migrated the financial information from downstream applications that had the logic for its functionality. This was the main reason for the data issue in the released product. Purnendu identified this gap and worked on the migration rollout strategy, which enabled options to receive financial data directly from legacy servicing systems instead of other downstream applications.

Post-implementation, the client was happy because they were benefited with an application re-platform. Also, they understood the value of documenting the as-is structural and content meaning of data to implement correct to-be business processes in the new product. With this approach, the product was released on time with no major issues. The client appreciated Purnendu's efforts which led to many new opportunities for TCS.",Identification Of Gaps For A Robust Actionable Solution,Iyanar Kumaravelu,Automative Finance,Digital Transformation,Growth & Transformation,Item,1

"In 2018, a North American investment bank was planning the migration of its legacy businesses into Broadridge (BR). George, the IT manager, was leading the project. He was nervous because they had to perform a large scale asset conversion of $25BN. Also, one of the biggest challenges was to ensure that all functionalities in the legacy system were accounted for in the new Broadridge system. Additionally, the senior management had set critical targets for all reconciliations between legacy and the new systems.

To meet the objective, George planned a mock conversion before the actual migration. During the first rehearsal, he discovered that a critical workflow for commission processing was missing as part of the migration. George also realized that this app was acquired a long time back, and there was limited knowledge among the team regarding the functionalities. Given the challenges about the application itself and the strict timelines, George decided to approach their existing IT partner, TCS.

For the TCS team, it was a complicated project because they were racing against time and were expected to resolve the existing problem. That's when Parthiban Ranganathan got selected as a contextual master to drive the project. This is because he had worked with the client in various projects and had gained a good understanding of their technology and business landscape. Besides, he was well acquainted with the client's requirements in the Broadridge system.



Upon understanding the task, Parthiban decided to develop the necessary interface with a new TML application. He created the trades in a new format to be accepted and processed for the FC Comp application. Parthiban took ownership of the entire process and liaised with the necessary interfaces and the BR team members to establish the blotter, firm account, source code, and customer account mapping of the new system. This mapping was essential so that the FC Comp output remained unchanged and the migration was seamless for the client.

The bank's senior management highly appreciated Parthiban's robust solution. His quick understanding of the process and his enormous efforts helped the bank to achieve the migration promptly as there were no show stoppers from the commission processing side. This strengthened the client-TCS relationship, which led to future engagements.",Legacy Modernisation A Path To Success,Rajagopal Pandian,Investment Banking,Legacy Transformation,Cost & Optimization,Item,1
"In 2018, a leading North American bank initiated the QPB program – Quant Prime Brokerage. The plan was to migrate all the important market areas to this program by 2020. As part of this initiative, the bank estimated an additional 10 million trades to be processed by TML application per day. This massive volume would increase the load to TML application by as much as 100%. This additional load would adversely affect the overall performance of the TML application, thereby resulting in client/regulatory reporting and settlements delay.

Sam, the Technical Chief of the Bank could foresee the challenges ahead. He knew that the major problem would be to handle the load with the existing infrastructure. Since costs also had to be taken into account, he couldn’t add too much additional infrastructure. At the same time, if the volume was not handled in a timely manner, the bank would incur an operational fee for the delay in reporting and settlements. Sam weighed the issues and the possible impact it would have on the Bank. Sam then approached TCS who was a major player in the OpSo area. It was imperative to brainstorm and handle the volume efficiently. Baskar Durai was made the Tech Lead of this project.

Baskar had knowledge of most of the applications in OpSo arena, due to his long stint with the bank. Baskar quickly jotted down the challenges to cross this hurdle. He interacted with other teams handling similar volumes and had multiple meetings to understand the pain points in the conversion process. Baskar did a feasibility study of various available options in order to handle this high volume. With his long stint in this bank, exposure on projects handling similar volumes and results from his feasibility study, Baskar proposed to split the Trading Engine into logical parts to effectively handle the anticipated volume spike.

Baskar proposed to segregate the QPB and BAU volume to minimize the impact to the existing processing rate. The solution was also designed to handle future volume growth. Baskar published a detailed analysis report showcasing how memory, space, database, EMS queues, etc could be shared across the proposed instances, but still, be viable. Baskar made use of the vast TCS landscape in the OpSo area by reaching out to various teams through his supervisor. He collated sufficient data points from multiple use-cases to produce as supporting documentation for his proposal.

The split approach proposed by Baskar was approved by the bank’s senior management and was implemented successfully in the first quarter of 2018. The Trade Life Cycle engine since then was able to handle the extra load as expected.
The client application manager of the Trade Life Cycle Engine was all praise about Baskar’s dedication and contribution. Baskar received “Star of the Quarter” GEMS award from TCS for his tremendous contribution to this thought-provoking journey. This helped TCS to continue its strong presence within the bank and to create a brand image.",Tml Application For Quant Prime Brokerage Program,Rajagopal Pandian,Investment Banking,Technology Infrastructure,Cost & Optimization,Item,1
"In 2019, Brain, the CEO of a leading global bank, came up with a new vision. He decided to design a new Collections Online Payment Assistance (COPA) user interface within the bank’s online digital channels. The new interface would specifically be designed for delinquent customers. It would help them to complete a self-service evaluation and select a qualifying Forbearance program, Paydown or Settlement, or a Non-forbearance program, Catch-up Plan or Reage, for enrollment. Consequently, it would eventually reduce the interactions with the customer service agents and thereby decreasing the total cost.

Brian called in a quick meeting and discussed the issue in detail. During the meeting, the most significant point that came up was that the bank’s digital channels were built using the new NextGen Architecture (NGA) platform. Hence, they demanded to communicate with the backend systems through micro-services. However, the backend systems involved in the collections processes were built on the legacy framework and relied on TIBCO services to communicate with the consumer applications. Thus, Brian conceptualized the idea of the ‘Collections Micro-Services’ team, which would be responsible for facilitating the bank’s applications required to service the delinquent customers.

Brian reached out to TCS for assistance, and Jassim Abdul Latheef from TCS was chosen to lead the initiative. Jassim had been associated with the bank’s Digitization & Technology operations for more than ten years. Also, he had worked with the bank’s Collections Front end applications and so possessed adequate contextual knowledge about the bank’s collection functionalities.
Jassim worked as the lead developer and built the new microservices team. Besides, he closely worked with the key stakeholders of the bank and worked towards the environment setup, the CI/CD process setup, and built the required microservices. On the other hand, Jassim had good rapport with different teams. He used his knowledge and contacts to get things rolling at every stage of the project.



Finally, the inception of the Collections Microservices made migrating several of the legacy mainframe calls to z/OS microservices possible. It was also expected that many functionalities owned by the Account Collections System (ACS) and Arrangement Utility (AU) would be migrated to z/OS and exposed to consumer applications as Microservice APIs. Also, it paved the path for the migration of several core collections functionalities built on the legacy framework to NGA, such as the Offer Utility Decision Engines.
In the end, the client was delighted with the results and immensely praised Jassim and his team. TCS, on the other hand, could cement a strong relationship with the client.",Successful Migration From A Legacy Application To The Microservices Platform,"MRJ, Mr. SABAREESH KUMAR (SABAREESH KUMAR)",Cards,Legacy Transformation,Growth & Transformation,Item,1
"In November 2018, George*, the CTO of a Financial service company for Automobile, called for an emergency meeting of the board. He was frantic because his team was facing a significant challenge in the migration. The source of data in the legacy requirement tool (Salesforce application) was not straightforward to migrate to JIRA. This was a stalemate situation because the business did not want to use the legacy requirement tool due to space limitation. The client wanted to migrate the history of requirements along with current data to JIRA before the Agile transformation. It was vital to manage and delete the data to maintain space, but this was a time consuming activity. George knew that he required an immediate solution to ensure that the plans of business are not in jeopardy. Hence, he approached TCS.

Thenmozhi M had joined the client in December 2018 to guide them on Agile transformation. She was informed in advance about the client’s expectation on the JIRA migration to be completed within a month before Agile Transformation. It was challenging since she did not have a salesforce team from TCS at client location. Additionally, she lacked knowledge about how to get the data from salesforce requirement tool from different vendors. The complexity of the situation did not deter her spirits. She took it up as a challenge and studied the nature of reports in salesforce tool. Thenmozhi and her team analysed the pain points in managing the legacy tool, the pattern on how the data is stored and identified which query tool would work best to retrieve the data in salesforce. With her previous experience in development, agile methodology and financial services, she identified the critical limitations and gaps in the legacy application. She performed a thorough analysis of the client’s business process to acquire the contextual knowledge.

Based on her contextual understanding, she realised that this initiative involved several challenges – consolidating requirements, data migration, coordinating with multiple stakeholders, cut-over strategy within exponentially reducing timeline and successfully guiding the team throughout the migration. The major challenge was that there were 250+ fields which were not crucial for the client and data was stored in more than one table. Also, each query tool retrieved the data in a different format and did not provide all the data.

Thenmozhi and her team performed a thorough analysis and came up with a comprehensive solution. She identified mandatory data that required migration and the fields in JIRA to map. Thenmozhi used different query tools to get the data and removed the areas which did not have data. She created macros to eliminate unwanted ASCII keys, fields and merged the vast data from different tables into a template. Thenmozhi and her team logically mapped the fields to JIRA and made sure most of the data from the salesforce tool are migrated to JIRA.

The client was impressed with the POC and signed a new SOW with TCS to complete the migration work. On successful project completion, Thenmozhi gained customer confidence that they could do a better job in salesforce and created a platform to add salesforce team from TCS at the client place.

Thenmozhi and her team performed a thorough analysis and came up with a comprehensive solution. She identified mandatory data that required migration and the fields in JIRA to map. Thenmozhi used different query tools to get the data and removed the areas which did not have data. She created macros to eliminate unwanted ASCII keys, fields and merged the vast data from different tables into a template. Thenmozhi and her team logically mapped the fields to JIRA and made sure most of the data from the salesforce tool are migrated to JIRA.

The client was impressed with the POC and signed a new SOW with TCS to complete the migration work. On successful project completion, Thenmozhi gained customer confidence that they could do a better job in salesforce and created a platform to add salesforce team from TCS at the client place. The overall project which was going to take four months got completed within one month. On a similar occasion, the guidance provided on the Agile process in this journey to the team and consultation provided to the client showcased how TCS was a strategic Growth & Transformation partner for the client.",Implementing Successful Migration From Legacy Application To Jira Systems,SENTHILNATHAN K.S,Automative Finance,Agile Transformation,Growth & Transformation,Item,1
"In November 2018, George*, the CTO of a Financial service company for Automobile, called for an emergency meeting of the board. He was frantic because his team was facing a significant challenge in the migration. The source of data in the legacy requirement tool (Salesforce application) was not straightforward to migrate to JIRA. This was a stalemate situation because the business did not want to use the legacy requirement tool due to space limitation. The client wanted to migrate the history of requirements along with current data to JIRA before the Agile transformation. It was vital to manage and delete the data to maintain space, but this was a time consuming activity. George knew that he required an immediate solution to ensure that the plans of business are not in jeopardy. Hence, he approached TCS.

Thenmozhi M had joined the client in December 2018 to guide them on Agile transformation. She was informed in advance about the client’s expectation on the JIRA migration to be completed within a month before Agile Transformation. It was challenging since she did not have a salesforce team from TCS at client location. Additionally, she lacked knowledge about how to get the data from salesforce requirement tool from different vendors. The complexity of the situation did not deter her spirits. She took it up as a challenge and studied the nature of reports in salesforce tool. Thenmozhi and her team analysed the pain points in managing the legacy tool, the pattern on how the data is stored and identified which query tool would work best to retrieve the data in salesforce. With her previous experience in development, agile methodology and financial services, she identified the critical limitations and gaps in the legacy application. She performed a thorough analysis of the client’s business process to acquire the contextual knowledge.

Based on her contextual understanding, she realised that this initiative involved several challenges – consolidating requirements, data migration, coordinating with multiple stakeholders, cut-over strategy within exponentially reducing timeline and successfully guiding the team throughout the migration. The major challenge was that there were 250+ fields which were not crucial for the client and data was stored in more than one table. Also, each query tool retrieved the data in a different format and did not provide all the data.

"In a pursuit to continuously enhance the customer experience, organizations relentlessly put business-technology innovation agenda at the forefront. Around a year ago, Emma, the Global Head of Operations and Fraud Prevention of a Global Leading Bank, had started an initiative. The mission focussed on digitally equipping the customer-facing agents. The objective was to enhance the client experience, improve customer loyalty, drive NPS (Net Promoter Score), and enable digital adoption for both employees and customers.
Emma was quick to engage in discussions with Rajnish Palande. Rajnish headed the TCS Global Relationship for the bank. Post discussion Emma asked Rajnish to join the initial launch of the ‘Digital experience lab’. The launch was to be held across the US locations of the bank. There were few demos during the session that focussed on collaborative learning. One of the demos was on the bank’s Knowledge Management portal called KM Hub.

During the demo, Rajnish noticed that the agent struggled to search the relevant content and could not track the proper document links. The result was that the overall time and effort to locate the relevant content was extensive. Rajnish shared his observation with the leadership team of the bank, and they took it on a positive note. The reason was that the ability to find the relevant content at a faster pace was critical for the bank when their agents were on the phone with the customers. Emma, along with other stakeholders of the bank, requested Rajnish to come up with a relevant solution. Rajnish was an organic choice because he had immense contextual knowledge about the bank’s business and IT landscape, their requirements and pain points.

Rajnish was quick to take up the challenge. First of all, he put together a core group, discussed with them and broke the problem into several parts. Rajnish and his team conducted a detailed Time and Motion study. The Time and Motion study indicated that the time taken by agents was greater than sixty seconds. The time increased further in the case of a new agent.

Rajnish and his team came up with a few solutions. For example, Smart Search, which had the ability to words based on the frequency of use, powered by data dictionary build up. Team Briefcase that had the ability to create, delete, manage the briefcase for their teams to organize the documents in folders. Then there was Access Control that involved role-based access control to key personnel to add and delete the documents in the briefcase. The ‘Match any word & Match exact word functionality’ comprised the ability for a user to search documents matching exact word of matching any word. Lastly, the ‘Display documents details in a Snapshot’ could see the details of the document in a snapshot-like Doc Name, description, Publish date, Update date.

The results of the solution were amazing. The average time to search across the set of documents and content had reduced to seven to ten seconds compared to the earlier sixty seconds. The leadership team of the bank was immensely happy with the quick turnaround time of the solution. Rajnish was applauded from all quarters.

"In a pursuit to continuously enhance the customer experience, organizations relentlessly put business-technology innovation agenda at the forefront. Around a year ago, Emma, the Global Head of Operations and Fraud Prevention of a Global Leading Bank, had started an initiative.

The objective was to enhance the client experience, improve customer loyalty, drive NPS (Net Promoter Score), and enable digital adoption for both employees and customers.
Emma was quick to engage in discussions with Rajnish Palande. Rajnish headed the TCS Global Relationship for the bank. Post discussion Emma asked Rajnish to join the initial launch of the ‘Digital experience lab’. The launch was to be held across the US locations of the bank. There were few demos during the session that focussed on collaborative learning. One of the demos was on the bank’s Knowledge Management portal called KM Hub.

During the demo, Rajnish noticed that the agent struggled to search the relevant content and could not track the proper document links. The result was that the overall time and effort to locate the relevant content was extensive. Rajnish shared his observation with the leadership team of the bank, and they took it on a positive note. The reason was that the ability to find the relevant content at a faster pace was critical for the bank when their agents were on the phone with the customers. Emma, along with other stakeholders of the bank, requested Rajnish to come up with a relevant solution. Rajnish was an organic choice because he had immense contextual knowledge about the bank’s business and IT landscape, their requirements and pain points.

Rajnish was quick to take up the challenge. First of all, he put together a core group, discussed with them and broke the problem into several parts. Rajnish and his team conducted a detailed Time and Motion study. The Time and Motion study indicated that the time taken by agents was greater than sixty seconds. The time increased further in the case of a new agent.

Rajnish and his team came up with a few solutions. For example, Smart Search, which had the ability to words based on the frequency of use, powered by data dictionary build up. Team Briefcase that had the ability to create, delete, manage the briefcase for their teams to organize the documents in folders.

"In the Digital era rather Digital Marketing era, (Hyper) personalisation & being relevant are the core experiences that every bank / financial institution are embarking on. Mass targeting is going back to the dark ages where traditional marketing did not care about who was sold what. Mass targeting is what will happen when you do not know what the customer is thinking or feeling. It is like the blind leading the blind.

Digital marketing is more about hyper-personalised offerings. In this race, everyone wants to win by providing seamless experience for increased flow of customer base.

Client, a large global bank (Consumer banking APAC operations) was no exception. While the business priorities were clear, the legacy platforms built on data stage and Teradata were not scaled up for real-time integration. Nor did it leverage the other ecosystems that were used in a real-time arena such as Google and Adobe. The client was facing a dilemma whether to build an in-house product or adopt a fin-tech.

Being unable to connect with their own clients, TCS was brought in to bridge the gap. Suresh Kumar came with in-depth contextual knowledge to create the perfect solution for the client leveraging the D&A trends, horizontal visibility intersected by vertical traceability of client’s end-to-end landscape. He had executed different data transformation initiatives namely, regional Enterprise Data Warehouse (EDW), common EDW, technology upgrade and various compliance and regulatory programs. Multisite rollout (rolled out across 17 markets) was the value proposition and core parameters for TCS to be on the upper hand.

Suresh was involved since the inception of the program starting from the core team formulation (batch, real-time, analytics, etc.) along with design and development of the key business use cases identified, namely., merchant recommendation engine (MRE), intelligent IVR, hyper-personalised loans (EPP), etc.

While the Data & Analytics Program (DAP) was gaining traction with the business users showcased by implementing the above use cases, Suresh as a TCS Solution Architect leveraged the larger TCS units like A&I, BFS-CoE for DATA maturity assessment (DATOM), showcasing similar success stories, critical PoC’s like model ops, and CICD. Suresh also brought in architectural propositions, platform optimisation, tech stack rationalisation etc. and a well-crafted three-year roadmap for taking the DAP from a delivery engagement to a strategic alliance.

This engagement lasted over a year and a half. Suresh leveraged his in-depth contextual knowledge of client’s ecosystem and collaboration of larger TCS. The Global Bank (APAC Operations) started its path towards improving customer experience levels. This led to a drop in complaints as well. Overall, business started reaping benefits to the tune of $512 Million by implementing the solutions brought in by Suresh.

The TCS Team is now fully operational on DAP Engagement, focusing on building capabilities such as data lake, Google and Adobe Integration and many such transformation initiatives such as Event Cloud, Customer Experience Use cases, Rapid Commercialisation, Talend Migration etc. Some of the success stories have been nominated for TCS Digital Symposium 2019, BFIS Sprint Stalls and have been received very well for Business 4.0 adoption.",Transforming The Journey Of Data And Improving Customer Satisfaction,AMIT KUMAR SONI,Retail Banking,Legacy Transformation,Growth & Transformation,Item,1
"In the mid of 2018, almost all leading banks were looking for an opportunity to upgrade the tech stacks to Open Source software to enable the core middleware application running on a lighter infra, thereby reduce the cost spent on licensing. This upgrade was mandatory to get the applications running on the Cloud Platform.

Robert Broad was holding a key position as General Manager-IT for one of the oldest Banks, which ran Middleware services in SOA architecture. Robert had initiated the work and the Host systems were wired through the Tibco software. The migration of the same to Cloud Architecture was the requirement. Robert sought the services of TCS to get this done. Srinivasan G had about 15 years’ experience working in TCS. He was associated with the bank since 2007, in the Banking Domain and Open Technology. He had considerable experience having worked along with stakeholders in bringing solutions for addressing the requirement. TCS was a major vendor in the middleware layer and had a resource pool available in Microservices. TCS was thus considered as the best in the industry to provide solutions on a large scale.

The Open APIs addressed the customers of the entire region with 300+ APIs cutting across the domains/products in the banking application. These APIs had to be migrated while keeping intact the Business Functionality. The AS-IS migration of this scale was accomplished in 4 Quarters with lots of domain and technical inputs coming from Srinivasan. Srinivasan used his domain expertise to rewrite a simplified design so that the Payments Domain APIs ran with many sequential calls and complex logic written in the BAU systems.

The Team formed for the AS-IS migration was a completely dynamic set of associates coming from different backgrounds (BPS re-badged associates, Freshers). Srinivasan’s first task was to get the team in the right direction and bring the associates on a full-fledged delivery mode. He took help from the TCS management to put things in the correct path and pulled it off by the first quarter of the migration deployment.

The bank’s customer base increased to a higher number and the business customers were happy with the response time and the easiness to take the products to production in no time. The data was displayed prominently on the dashboards derived out of the systems that monitored the performance.

During the implementation of the migration Srinivasan and his team also brought in new process improvements in the client’s environment and developed new automation tools. Srinivasan's knowledge of Robert’s team’s process and access to all stakeholders was an advantage. He effectively monitored the progress of the Project such that all the milestones were met without any deviations and penalties.

Robert appreciated the efforts put in by Srinivasan and confirmed the solution to meet all their requirements. One of the key aspects of making the project a success was the governance and co-ordination across the teams. The bank was immensely pleased with the solution and had no hesitation in rewarding the project as the best PI implementation for the year 2020 at the Unit level.",Microservices Based Program To Support A Mandatory Upgrade To A Cloud Platform,SHAROAN Mohammed,Retail Banking,Technology Infrastructure,Growth & Transformation,Item,1
"In the past few decades, the world has come to terms with the new normal being email transactions for all business communications. With email communication becoming increasingly essential for every business, there was a growing need for email content archival too. Great strides had been made on personal email archival on various fronts, however, there was not much progress on the business side of it.

The client had this important requirement to archive and retrieve email communications with their customers on demand. The plan was to seek the help of the existing infrastructure team. It was suggested to use the IBM Cloud Object Storage (COS) maintained by the G360 team to retrieve whenever required for audit or review based on business needs.

As part of ASC Digital customer communication and ICAP, a process was established in DCF to archive all email communication sent to end-customers as this functionality not available earlier. The IBM COS (Cloud object storage) was set-up in the G360 application and this storage had been used by the statements and other teams historically for different purposes. Hence this storage was utilized for email archival and it was proposed for all email outputs created by DCF for Cheetah to ensure the emails were archived with the required metatags. Metatags were a feature requirement of the IBM setup and hence was required to store and retrieve email transactions at IBM COS.

The TCS team led by Ravichandran Mohan was tasked to build a solution to make this email archival happen. Since email letters archival and retrieval was required as a part of the digital drive for future reference Ravichandran began to analyze and verify multiple areas in the client system and worked with other client stakeholders in various LOBs to understand the requirements deeply and provide solution on request.

Ravichandran analyzed the DCF Mainframe batch and email processes and letter archival and prepared the metadata and key values for archival and retrieval. Also, he looked into the existing AIX execution areas, MessagePoint and Exstream composition tools and defined new queues along with new flows to archive them via batch processing in real-time without impacting current Cheetah Digital communication process.

The client stakeholders appreciated this innovative and cost-effective solution on new archival and retrieval system for emails and agreed to install the changes to production. On successful completion of the system, it began to business and production support team to get a copy of emails without any delay. The system also did the auto reconciliation to ensure all emails were archived. There were checks created to inform the G360 team for intervention if there was any delay in the archival process. It reduced a lot of manual effort.
This email archival and retrieval process was found to be extremely efficient as it extracted samples from IBM COS quickly, and shared back the samples to the requestor from the production support team without any delay. It was indeed an interesting learning experience for Ravichandran and his team for having implemented this new email archival process.",Implementation Of A Robust Email Archival System With Metatagbased Retrievals,SHAROAN Mohammed,Cards,Process optimization,Cost & Optimization,Item,1
"In the year 2016, as per the direction of Jose, the Business Head of the client organization, the second-largest bank in Mexico, the first lapse process was turned on. But due to issues in the historical data migrated from legacy it was turned off again after running for a few months. The bank offered a Premia rewards card, which was used as a redemption card. Customers could use this card in ATMs/POSs to withdraw/purchase in pesos equivalent to the points available. For the Premia product, calculation of the Purse/Lapse points used to be an ad hoc process and the Business used to download reports manually. Earlier, the points purge period was set as 4 years.

In October 2019, the TCS Team had implemented the automation of the Premia purge/lapse processing and update of the purge period. The Business had reported approx. 2.2 M USD financial benefit for the purge period update. The lapse process was not automated and the team had to do manual intervention before sending the final lapse report to the client. They had proposed TCS to make this process automated and do the correction of the historical data. After automating the process, the lapse/purge process was stable and the client updated the purge period to 3 years.

Subir Biswas, as placed by TCS, was working in the rewards (Cards loyalty system) for the last 6 years and handled many critical projects for different markets (GC, LATAM). He had been working closely with the Mexico DM team for the last 4 years and gained complete knowledge in the Mexico rewards flow. This experience helped him a lot to make this process automated. Before implementation of the new process, first, he and his team had to correct issues related to the statement of historical data, Premia card issuance, and Premia program enrollment. After correcting, they proposed to automate the purge/lapse processing to the cards business. CM did the design and development of the new automated process.

In the earlier processes, the production support team used to submit a set of jobs manually to 1) exclude the forfeited points while the calculation of purge 2) consider negative adjustment as the redeemed points and 3) send the final report in OnDemand. CM and his team made this automated and monitored the new process closely. Besides, they regularly sent reports to the business with control figures to build confidence. After developing confidence in this new process, the client updated the purge period to 3 years. CM supported the testing in the lower environments like loading historical data in the database, sending reports to the business, and customer level lapse calculation in detail before it was implemented in production. In September 2019, after the purge period was set to 3 years, the total points lapsed almost to 815 M (earlier trend was 50 M points lapsed per month).

After a thorough validation, the TCS team was happy to confirm that the change in the points expiration for the PREMIA program went successful. The client including the Mexico DM Spoc extended their gratitude for the great work, and appreciated all the support the TCS team gave to perform this strategic change that brought financial benefits directly on the program reserves (Approx 2.2 M USD). The Rewards App Manager also applauded the team’s effort in monitoring this crucial exercise.",Automation Of Premia Purgelapse Processing,"M, Mr. KARTHEKEYAN (Karthekeyan)",Cards,Automation,Cost & Optimization,Item,2
"International companies are inclined to adopt Agile ecosystems nowadays. Stability, scalability and agile strategies define the success of journeys of agile teams.

A major bank and credit card conglomerate in North America was remodeling its software development model from Waterfall to Agile. Heath Streak, the Head of product development was heading this transformation. The Agile journey teams would now have defined boundaries of functionality to support and develop. The transition phase had many challenges and the major one being the creation and maintenance of the agile environment. Agile journey teams had to spend most of their efforts in looking after the environment thereby hampering productivity. This was a worrying factor that Heath wanted to overcome.

TCS was the client partner of the international bank for a long time now. The transition on the client-side meant a transition on the TCS side too, since most of the Agile team members were from TCS. Debarshi, the Program Manager from TCS, was handling this transformation in TCS for the client. Heath turned to Debarshi for a solution, since both knew that the production is on the decline due to this transition.

Debarshi understood that it was equally important for TCS to fix this, as it was hurting their productivity too. Debarshi who was closely associated with the client for a long time now, having worked with several scrum teams wanted to find the root cause for low team velocity. He carried on Fish Bone analysis over multiple scrum teams’ delivery matrices and discovered that environment instability was the major affecting factor. The next task in the queue for Debarshi was to find a solution to fix these environmental instabilities. Deb’s contextual and domain knowledge in development environments enabled him to come up with a unique solution to improve the team’s velocity. A web-based automation tool built on Angular and possessing microservices capabilities was developed to fix environmental instabilities in one click. Now the Agile teams leveraged this tool to simplify their daily routines like team creation, Jenkins job creation, certificate synch up, build and deployment which was just a click away.

Heath was a happy man now because he could see that this tool increased the velocity of scrum teams’ delivery by 5% which meant better growth in product development. Starting with fewer development environments, the potential of the tool attracted several Agile development teams to use it to the fullest potential. This is the most preferred tool by almost all the Agile Teams to maintain their environments. This was a win-win solution as this tool helped to improve TCS’ productivity too. Within TCS, it was a much-appreciated solution and fetched Spot award at the BFSI level.

This story was instrumental in turning a long-standing relationship with the client to a long-lasting one. Heath appreciated the technical acumen and good understanding of the client’s ecosystem that TCS and Debarshi possessed that helped to find a quick and long-lasting solution. This was a new feather in the cap of TCS’ Business 4.0 strategy.",A Transformation Journey That Changed A Longstanding Relationship To A Longlasting Trust,"MRJ, Mr. SABAREESH KUMAR (SABAREESH KUMAR)",Retail Banking,Agile Transformation,Growth & Transformation,Item,1
"It was a bright sunny morning in the year 2016 and everything around was merry and pretty. However, it was not a great morning for Walter, who was the CFO of a leading Financial Services company in the US. His teams had missed some important SLAs and this raised questions among the management and investors. Walter had to figure out the root cause of this problem and ensure that it was fixed immediately.

So, when he delved deeper, he identified that the users used to report various financial activities to regulators manually on a monthly basis. As this had to be completed in a timely manner, users needed to spend a lot of extra hours to get this done. As a result of this, SLAs were missed. It was a “Eureka” moment for Walter when it struck to him that automating some of the manual work in an Agile Way would not just solve the impending challenges but also be a step towards digitization.



The client is the first financial services company in the U.S. to bring together banking, insurance, and investments under one umbrella. Its 300,000 employees manage 200 million customer accounts across six continents in more than 100 countries. Securitization is one of the sub-application, that has various financial reports to provide to regulators and capital markets. This process was taking a long time as the reporting was done manually by gathering various reports in the system. As the strategic IT partner of the client, the TCS Management sensed the problem and determined that automation was the best way to resolve these challenges.

On TCS’s appointment, Jithendra Nallabothu, who had been working with the client since 2007, was chosen to lead this initiative. During his tenure with the client, he learnt many subsystems that were available with the client. In addition to that, he gained immense knowledge of the Securitization business through some online tutorials.

Jithendra Nallabothu joined as Business Analyst in this application and used to discuss various business requirements with peers, seniors and other teams involved. During his conversations with key stakeholders, he learnt that of the various automation opportunities available. Furthermore, he identified an additional reason for the delay in delivering the projects due to following of Traditional Waterfall Method. Around the same time, there was a buzz around moving to an Agile way of working and Jithendra’s findings proved to be the perfect catalyst for adopting this methodology.

As a business analyst, Jithendra had in-depth knowledge of the application and he proposed to the stakeholders that the existing application could generate the reports automatically to save time. In addition, the project would work in an Agile way so the working software would be available sooner than expected.

TCS had various learning tools to be able to do the project in the “Agile” way and Jithendra trained himself to be well-versed with them and utilized this acquired knowledge in his project delivery. The development team worked to automate the required reports and delivered the project in 3 months in an ‘Agile’ way which otherwise would have taken 9 months.

The users of the application were very happy that their reports were available systemically with no manual intervention. Manual errors were substantially reduced. They are able to concentrate/use their time to perform other productive activities. Walter was thrilled with the outcome and appreciated the team immensely.

As the reports were delivered automatically, the client could identify similar work and automate the same with reduced manual intervention. Moreover, as project delivery moved to Agile, users were able to prioritize more work and in turn, TCS bagged more projects to work on in this domain.",Automation Of Reporting Through The Agile Way Of Working,SHAROAN Mohammed,Cards,Reporting,Growth & Transformation,Item,1
"It was a regulatory requirement for the Life Insurance Company based in the US, to have a system that could process policy payments and send the details to a leading bank. But, Tery, the IT Head of the firm understood that making an update to the existing application to incorporate this functionality was not a viable option. Their existing legacy system couldn’t process both the Binding Coverage Payment & Initial Premium Payment for the Life and Annuity policies that they acquired from another major Insurance company in the United States during the year 2018. Processing the Premium Payment for newly converted policies was challenging with the stipulated time provided by regulatory agencies. They were left with only one option to process payment for all the policies and that was through a manual mode.

The challenge with the manual mode of processing was that it took a lot of effort to process every policy, which was not advisable. This situation impacted them to look for a better option to process payment for the policies, instantly. If this situation was not addressed, they would not have been able to process the payment for converted policies and this could result in compliance issues. The major impact could be monetary loss along with the loss of business.

TCS had been considered as a trusted business partner for the client for several years and this situation demanded TCS to step-in immediately to assist the client with a solution. By finding a solution, the client would be able to process several payments for the policies within the required time, increase their revenue and this would benefit TCS in gaining more client confidence thereby driving in several new projects. To solve the issue, TCS would have to spend several hours in understanding the existing application logic and discuss with different teams within the client organization.



Karthikeyan Rajkumar had an in-depth knowledge of the client’s technology landscape and environment provisioning details. After working with the client for several years, the Karthikeyan very well knew which solution would solve the client's problem and also minimize the manual efforts.

Karthikeyan played the role of Technical Lead, as placed by TCS, and analyzed the business requirements of the client and derived it into an executable solution. He came to know about the client's problem through a Business Analyst working in the client’s organization. After hearing about the problem, Karthikeyan worked with the Business Analyst to understand the pain areas encountered by business users daily. Major challenges were faced by Karthikeyan when interacting with a team whose primary responsibility was to create Enterprise Services that process Payment transactions with the Bank.


Since Karthikeyan had already faced a lot of challenges with the existing environment it helped him easily overcome environmental issues while implementing the solution. Karthikeyan possessed a knowledge of how the Insurance industry worked in the United States and that helped him immensely when solving the problem. He approached the experts from TCS while confirming a solution for the problem and then he had the TCS team from Offshore to assist with the implementation. Karthikeyan proposed an idea of creating a portal that would be primarily used by the business users within the client’s organization for processing the converted policies. This payment portal was built using ASP.net Technology and it internally used an API to fetch policy details.

Tery felt very happy about the solution and thanked Karthikeyan and the entire TCS team who helped in implementing the solution within a short time. With this solution, the client was able to process payment for thousands of policies and generate more revenue for their organization. The client appreciated the Karthikeyan and TCS team for the quick turnaround in addressing their problem. This benefited TCS to gain high customer satisfaction and to bag several new projects from the client.",A Solution To Process Payments For Converted Policies,Arindam Adhikari,Insurance,Regulatory & Compliance,Cost & Optimization,Item,1
"It was a regulatory requirement for the Life Insurance Company based in the US, to have a system that could process policy payments and send the details to a leading bank. But, Tery, the IT Head of the firm understood that making an update to the existing application to incorporate this functionality was not a viable option. Their existing legacy system couldn’t process both the Binding Coverage Payment & Initial Premium Payment for the Life and Annuity policies that they acquired from another major Insurance company in the United States during the year 2018. Processing the Premium Payment for newly converted policies was challenging with the stipulated time provided by regulatory agencies. They were left with only one option to process payment for all the policies and that was through a manual mode.

The challenge with the manual mode of processing was that it took a lot of effort to process every policy, which was not advisable. This situation impacted them to look for a better option to process payment for the policies, instantly.

"It was about six months since the business team of a leading global bank launched a product for the personal loans market. But there was no demand despite the many unique features it offered. When the business intelligence team of the bank was looking for reasons why the product had not enthused customers yet, they were unable to get a full picture, since only 1 percent of total call center volume is routed for customer survey.

In the absence of robust customer feedback, it all boiled down to the voice operations unit of the bank not performing as per expectation and the bank’s CTO Joshua Manson was asked to get the problem sorted out. On scrutiny, Joshua found that TCS, which was associated with the bank and offering voice support services, was undershooting deliverables. He wanted better results from the consultancy and reiterated the bank’s requirements to the TCS team.

The crisis came as a shot in the arm for TCS. The consultancy immediately brought in Shiv Kumar Saluja, who had delivered several IT projects for different customers, to improve performance of voice operations of TCS. The bank was measuring key parameters in voice operations. These metrics decided the weightage of a particular site. The challenge before Shiv was huge as the measurement of performance of TCS was across multiple sites, across various vendors, and based on multiple parameters dependent on people, quality, and sale.

He started the project by interacting with multiple groups to understand the root cause of the problem. He realized that radical changes were required in the process but also knew that he will have to take the team along to accept the change. He laid down a vision to get the operations TCS handled to the top three among 10 sites within 9 quarters. This helped him bring large team under one umbrella. His connections with human resource, performance improvement, and training groups came in handy as they readily agreed to support the project.

Shiv focused on daily calibration (kind of retrospective meeting in Agile), where performance of individuals was discussed and areas of improvement identified, which helped individuals perform better. Performance of key parameters was tracked each day, week, month and quarter. Swift action was taken on daily Key Performance Indicators. Also, real-time detractor surveys by unit manager helped identify problems. Quartile associates were closely monitored and were sent for training.

Volume types were studied in depth and refresher sessions organized to keep tabs. Sharing best practices among the team helped retrospection. In three quarters, TCS moved up from 9th position to the 2nd compared with all language sites (and first in the English site).

"It was high time that banks looked beyond digitising existing services and established open banking platforms for connected digital services. In 2015, the Banking industry was getting disrupted by Digital & Fintech Companies. Evidently, API banking was soon becoming an integral part of business models for many banks. As the number of devices proliferated, it became vital for customers and providers of information to have a standard method of connecting to each other via APIs.

Gary*, the CFO of one of the largest global banks in consumer and private banking, felt the urge to go beyond in-house innovation and find partners to foster Innovation. Digitisation initiatives across the bank happened in silos, inhibiting enterprise wide transformation and no new business models were built leveraging the digital capabilities. Hence, TCS partnered with the client across the spectrum of the API initiative for transformation using Open Banking APIs.

Fintech group was created to deliver a radical, connected customer experience, enabled by the next generation technology. Globally distributed TCS teams working across Singapore, North America, Chennai and Kolkata collaborated to deliver this solution in a scrum based agile model. Rajesh Ranjan, the TCS, API Partnership and Development Lead, had been working with the client for the last six years and was a part of the API Team since the Open Banking API program kicked-off in the Bank in Singapore. Also acquaintance with the client’s processes and business functionality of different domains, helped him and the TCS team build open APIs.

Rajesh, held a good track record of delivering multiple projects of the client in the past due to which he was nominated for delivering the API initiative. Through these years, Rajesh acquired deep understanding of the client’s technical architecture and framework, infrastructure, technology stack, multiple API management products, client’s processes ,business functionality of different domains – Retails, Cards, Banks, Acquisition, Payments, knowledge about industry standards related to the API security framework, design and governance. Along with the TCS team’s rich domain expertise, a detailed analysis was performed by Rajesh, which revealed that 56 out of 800 services contributed to 85% of customer interaction with the Bank. Rajesh and his team helped the client to launch the global API developer portal over the internet to rapidly connect with developers/partners across the globe. This enabled them to build innovative client solutions faster than ever before using APIs in sandbox.

Through the global developer portal which was freely available over the internet in APAC, EMEA, India and USA region, partners signed up and played with APIs in sandbox and integrated with their app/website before they approached the Bank. API approach improved velocity (Agile Metrics) by 3 times in the SDLC process. The Bank achieved 94% reduction in customer research costs via new B2B Partners and innovative partner onboarding solutions based on APIs. With this transformation with-in Bank using 300+ Open Banking APIs, today the bank is live with 70+ partners belonging to retails, insurance, travel, aggregator, telecom, banking/finance, transport and payments domain. Several appreciations were received from all the stakeholders.

"It was holiday season in 2013, but Sue, the CIO of a leading global investment banking and financial services provider, found little to cheer. With application and network outages impacting the authorizations flow, many Christmas shoppers were using the credit cards of the corporation’s competitors to buy gifts. The financial implications were huge, as was the hit to reputation.

Tracing back to the root cause of the outages exposed an utter lack of coordination between application, infrastructure and business, along with a non-resilient network infrastructure. Without a central repository to relate application to infrastructure, the change management process was rendered ineffective, and without oversight to implement any changes. Thankfully for Sue, TCS had entered into a contract with the corporation to provide application support services for the GCG sector the same year. So, Sue presented TCS with the challenge and asked them for help in addressing them.

Understanding the implications and their magnitude, the consultancy asked associate Srinivas Raghavan to take charge. Having worked with the client for 13 years, he had extensive knowledge of the client’s credit card business and was expertly trained in implementing the ITIL Service Management framework. Over the years, he had also learnt how the applications in interacted with each other and third-party ones. In his time with the client, Srinivas had also been assigned to lead the Retail Partner Cards Production Support team, and had then been engaged on all the service outage calls.

So, he had experienced first-hand the various technological and process gaps that existed. Due to the lack of a CMBD, it was difficult to assess the impact of any change. Thanks to Srinivas’ deep contextual knowledge of the client’s architecture and processes, he grasped the problem and prepare a roadmap to swiftly streamline the Change Management Process. As the first step, Srinivas met the application, business and infrastructure teams to identify the various relationships and configured them in the ServiceNow CMDB. To address network resilience issues, he found the single point of failures and set up Process Committee forum to brainstorm and fix the process gaps.

Srinivas and his team worked with the business stakeholders and set up green zones for change implementation. Daily calls were scheduled to discuss the changes with the business and validation steps were documented. Srinivas worked tirelessly with the team to automate some of the routine validation steps and enabled the team to detect change-related issues faster.
Due to these efforts, the volume of change-related and infrastructure-related incidents reduced by 25 percent YoY and the client was able to implement 99.5 percent of their changes without any issues. The client’s application availability increased, winning over more retailers to tie-up with them for credit-card issuing business. Srinivas’ solution highly appreciated by the client, who also renewed its contract with TCS.",Automation Solution To Minimize Network Outages,SHAROAN Mohammed,Cards,Automation,Growth & Transformation,Item,1
"It was in Dec'2011 that there was an urgent request from the Application Development Manager of APAC, for Vasanth to travel to Singapore. A critical project with visibility to the Major Global bank's CEO was in RED. The contractual obligations between the bank and another organization were drawn to deliver the project had been breached, and the project was in no shape to be launched. Where TCS was to perform a supporting role with Quality Assurance had to be now completely managed, developed, and made ready for the market launch by Vasanth and his team. Richard wore a dejected look as he introduced himself as the single point of contact from the bank to interact with Vasanth.

Vasanth already had complete contextual knowledge of the bank's ATM landscape with his now 14 years of ATM experience. Once in Singapore, he quickly understood the design aspects of the project and got to work on the MVP. Schemas were revisited and architectural aspects were tweaked to ensure that they remained light-weight yet future compatible for extensions. Vasanth and his team had much work to do on the UI, which was laid out to follow a single line of flow, and now had to be rewired for dynamic flows based on variable conditions.

With no support from the vendors, the team salvaged the product and delivered incremental versions, with each cut delivering a major functionality. The project tagged for Jun'12 launches, finally made to the market by Jan'13 after passing rigorous testing. Thus, the world's FIRST SMART ATM with customer shortcuts for favorite transactions, Video teller assist, Targeted and location-based marketing campaigns, instant account opening and card issuance was launched! It was a great moment for the TCS team to be personally invited for the launch in one of the upscale markets in Singapore, attended by the Client CEO and their Board of Directors.

With the UI work done on the SMART ATMs, the team also set out to revamp the 20 years old UI on ATMs with more user intuitive and responsive features. The Net Promoter Score of the ATM Application improved drastically and had already become the benchmark for the bank.

The TCS team led by Vasanth repeatedly demonstrated their capabilities. Richard was confident that he could depend on Vasanth at the moment of crisis. The resolution of the bank’s problem generated greater interest from the client on new TCS initiatives. Vasanth was already on the design chair for the next smart wave of cloud-based ATMs that the bank was planning. With Robot-based testing, a solution developed by the TCS Cognitive Computing team, to emulate manual testing and MFDM based production support models already proposed and Proof of Concept successfully demonstrated, Vasanth and his team started redefining the relationship with the bank and confident of taking it to the next level.

Vasanth, a Contextual Master, went on to drive the ATM Center of Excellence and extend his knowledge in RFPs and proposals for major banks in LATAM, Mexico and Asia.",Centre Of Excellence To Build Smart Atms,SENTHILNATHAN K.S,Retail Banking,Digital Transformation,Growth & Transformation,Item,1
"It was the day of the company’s annual meeting. On this day, Stuart, the CEO of one of the largest banks in the world, would be addressing all the employees of the bank. Everyone was keen to know more about the progress of the organization because it had a direct impact on their careers. Stuart started with the good news that the bank was successful in opening numerous digital channels and had also acquired new portfolios. The result was that the bank could realize a surge in business volume through an increase in the number of accounts and transaction volume. A huge round of applause followed his announcement.

But soon, Stuart mentioned that he had something more to discuss. It was about the high Mainframe application cost due to increased business volume. Also, the bank was facing a latency in response time for the online Accounts and mobile applications due to the increase in code complexity. Hence, a solution needs to be found soon.

One of the members from the bank’s leadership team suggested seeking assistance from TCS. Stuart agreed to it and got in touch with TCS. Soon, Karthick Rajendran from TCS was given the responsibility to address the issue. Karthick had been working with the bank for around ten years, so he had contextual knowledge about their business processes. Also, he had worked on multiple applications like Host Interface, Authorizations, and Rewards. Thus, Karthick analyzed the Mainframe application and identified inefficient codes.
Based on the OPEX report, Karthick shortlisted the transactions with more volumes and MIPs cost and came up with an idea of optimizing the backend modules codes to reduce the number of MIPs. Most importantly, he proposed a step-by-step solution, which led to a savings of $535,000.





Karthick proposed the AO Dashboard lite call enhancement. This was helpful because earlier, the Rewards module was returning a large number of fields to HIT, but only a few fields were passed back to AO. Hence, he introduced a new call to pass back only required fields leading to a savings of $183K. Similarly, he came up with, ‘Removing the Pass continue Global Elements from GETO & Dash.’ In this, the BT offer was considered as passed. This happened when the global element failed with a warning message to the front end. Thus, Arun suggested the idea to create the new BT criteria, without the pass continuing with global element resulting in a savings of $194K. Finally, Karthick and his team came up with the ‘Rewards Lite call Enhancements.’ In this program, the Rewards Offers passed to the front end after reading the records of the Eligibility table. To pass only the offers the cardmember could enroll, he provided a solution to build a new table, leading to a savings of $158K.

The client was enthralled with the huge amount of savings that they could make. Also, they could realize a surge in their savings, and there was an increase in CSI due to the improved response time. Karthick and his team received numerous accolades for the good work, and TCS emerged as a trusted partner of the client.",Optimization Of Legacy Mainframe Applications,SHAROAN Mohammed,Cards,Process optimization,Cost & Optimization,Item,1
"It was the first day at work in a new organisation for Pat* and as luck would have it, that was the day when the Federal Reserve Board (FRB) had sent a note that the organization had to develop a globally consistent Anti-Money Laundering (AML) Transaction Monitoring (TM) model for Credit Cards to enhance monitoring of their Global Consumer Bank (GCB) Cards businesses, including card issuing and merchant acquiring. Since Pat was heading the credit card arm of the business, he had to meet the senior management to discuss it.

After discussions, it was decided to approach TCS to meet this requirement. Since this is a critical project, it was assigned to Rajesh Pandian because of his past experience in the credit card industry and his long association with the client.

Hearing the pain points, Rajesh Pandian immediately knew that as a first step, his team had to develop and test what is needed to send recurring feeds to EAP. With his knowledge in this area, Rajesh Pandian understood that the requirement is to generate the feed for all Authorization records, all Transaction records for a particular day and for the same Transacted record, the team has to prepare the Customer record for the same day.

This was challenging to say the least because they had to utilize the existing data in the BI repository, there was a data lag, and the layout of all these three feeds was common across the globe, so each region had to match the existing layout for their own regions and data what they have.

Rajesh had worked with the client in different projects, so tapping into his knowledge of the client's systems, he came up with a list of all use case scenarios needed for generating the customer card, transaction, and authorization feed mapping. He used ETL Abinitio and SAS to join the right data from 20 to 25 high volume tables simultaneously. Since Rajesh Pandian knew the data flow in BI perfectly, he planned the schedule and agreed to come up with a three-day lag schedule. By doing so, Rajesh was able to prepare the feed with 100% completeness instead of partial data by meeting the SLA on time as well.

The acumen of Rajesh Pandian and the efforts of his team helped to pull off this complex project and in turn, enabled the client to meet the requirements of the FRB.

Following this successful implementation, more such critical projects came up Rajesh Pandian’s way through the same client and all of those were executed successfully as well.

"It’s not just about the victory, but the valiant effort put into the battle that made a difference. Michelle always gave her best into anything she tried. She was part of the team that liaised with the TFS-TCS Global team and believed in them because they had won many fierce battles in the past and was brave enough to accept the toughest challenge yet that was put in front of them.

Michelle’s company wanted to migrate its Global DW applications from on-premise to the AWS cloud environment within six months. The driving force for the migration was licensing cost and support ending by Mar’2019 for the client, complicated process to expand capacity on-premise, TFS InfoSec resistance of hosting Global financial data and the need to gain economic efficiency on Infrastructure.

TFS provides a variety of finance and insurance products to authorized vehicle dealers. TCS BI team has been a partner of the client since its inception. Along with stringent timeline, some of the significant speed breakers included a delay in the environment setup and availability along with multiple rounds of framework enhancement to accommodate different scenarios. The data loading framework was unable to test multiple files in parallel. There was a space issue in E2 and redshift that impacted history migration. There was a need for the additional scope to be absorbed to move along.

Migration to Cloud was a very important step for TFS and this project being the first of its kind encountered all the challenges. TCS, as a partner, had the sole responsibility to ensure TFS began on the right path to enable successful cloud adoption and achieve high values from it. Soma Nandu from TCS was nominated as the contextual master to lead the initiative. She came in with a strong financial services business acumen, experience in Cloud technologies and knowledge of the TFS ecosystem for more than three years. It helped the team with a clear understanding of the business requirements. Soma guided the client with a holistic view of the risks and mitigation strategies to choose the right cloud computing model, thus ensuring enhanced customer experience with the new cloud environment.

"Jack had an uphill task. The deadline was tight and any error on his part would have broken down a bank. As a project manager of a major digital bank, he had been tasked with the Oracle database upgradation by the Environmental and Operation (E&O) Management and the CIOs. The current Oracle system being run by the bank was outdated and hence incapable of meeting the performance standards and company expectations.

The bank used two major tier-level applications that relied on the Oracle systems which housed the entire customer data. It specifically hampered customer logins and impacted infrastructure, performance, and system resilience in general. Doing nothing would have impacted the business capability and the bank missing several critical SLAs.

Looking for a complete consultation-cum-implementation partner, Jack got in touch with TCS, who in turn called in the specialist. Vignesh Swamidurai, a TCS veteran of 14+ years, was a domain consultant with production support expertise. His ITIL and Six Sigma-certified green belt had successfully managed several Run the Bank (RTB) projects.


Vignesh soon came to know of the multiple incidents that had resulted in thousands of Failed Customer Interactions (FCI) over the past year and a half – four SEV1 and 2 SEV2. The application was the top priority for the bank and was designed to work 24x7 without any outage. However, the unplanned database server outages were adding to the maintenance cost as the production support group was maintaining 60+ physical and virtual servers. Since Oracle was the single point of storage, Vignesh decided to migrate it to the updated Oracle Exadata.

Vignesh was aware of the issues plaguing the client as he had been providing L2/L3 production support to the client for two and a half years now. He identified the issues in using golden gate implementation methodology over the Arman backup process and designed a PoC after several brainstorming sessions and conducting a range of tests.

Working on the project for four months, Vignesh successfully implemented the solution in November 2019 without any impact or outage of the client-facing system. The implementation, which lasted for 16 hours and involved 40+ steps, was a piece of cake for him. He met the stipulated timelines even as he worked parallelly on the production support project. He and the team also decommissioned the legacy database and servers post-go-live.

The client was highly impressed with the project and appreciated the tremendous benefits that they accrued from it. Resulting in zero downtime, zero incidents, improvement in performance, reduced response time of online calls, increased robustness and resilience of a Tier 1 application – the solution became a role model for all future migration projects.",Endtoend Migration Solution For Customer Satisfaction,Hariharaprasad Iyer,Cards,Production Management,Cost & Optimization,Item,1
"Jacob, the IT head of a leading global bank, was sold on cloud computing and had put in place a transformation plan after weighing the pros and cons of implementing it in business. The bank operated in more than 160 countries and Jacob, after analysis, realized that a cloud strategy would make the bank’s IT services more flexible and deliver new and improved products and services to its clients at a lower cost.

With that in mind, he launched the “Get To Cloud” initiative, targeting five applications that would enable elastic runtime and continuous delivery of digital applications. However, Jacob and his team couldn't migrate these applications all by themselves, and so, he turned to TCS, the bank’s oldest external vendor, for help them with the mega migration.

TCS was more than willing to help and asked Parnab Basak to lead the project. Parnab had been working with the bank for the last 10 years, and in this time had gained an in-depth understanding of the client's business and processes. He also had extensive knowledge of the client’s cloud infrastructure, and designing, operating, and troubleshooting solutions. His multiple certifications across different cloud domains were a bonus that made him the perfect lead for the project.

Soon after joining the CTO team, Parnab set out to understand the client’s requirements: A cloud-native architecture based on cloud architectural principles that could maintain security in the cloud, achieve operational excellence, and extend existing private cloud features. Once done, Parnab realized that the client needed an effective and connected Hybrid platform that would provide seamless integration to help the customer support with a spectrum of use cases. All they had to do was use a common set of cloud services, tools, and APIs across all involved technology stacks.






With continued support from his team, Parnab built an architecture that was firmly grounded on the key principles of event-driven, microservices/API-based, public cloud-native solutions that drove agility, cost-effectiveness, and quality. He also created patterns by composing discrete services together. These patterns helped convert the current tools through production workloads into fully AWS-native solutions.

Parnab also created an enterprise ""End-to-End Specific Patterns"" for specific workloads (Hybrid Microservices, Batch Processing, Web Application, File Ingestion, etc.) along with ""Cross-Functional Single Capabilities"" (Messaging, Monitoring, Session Management, API Management, Encryption, etc.), which were adopted by the migrating application to compose their systems architecture.

After the project wrap, Jacob thanked Parnab and his team for the exceptional work, since with their new solution, the applications could now secure approvals from cloud architecture review boards and the information security review procedures were faster. The bank now had a working operational service model of delivery for Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), Software as a Service (SaaS), as well as public, private, and hybrid cloud services that paved the way for a faster cloud adoption and migration.",Cloudnative Hybrid Platform To Achieve Operational Excellence,SHAROAN Mohammed,Cards,Digital Transformation,Growth & Transformation,Item,1
"Jane*, Director of a leading company in the Cards business, was anxious about its future, which was at serious risk of closure. The operational cost of this business was growing at an unacceptable 30% YoY, and the net promoter score was also dropping consistently. This was directly affecting the business’ user base and revenues. In such a situation, the company was not even able to deliver new enhancements as damage control.




Jane, who was heading the operational excellence team, requested the TCS team to help with this challenge. She attributed this cost mainly towards Mainframe MIPS costs and hence, invited a team of consultants to review the Mainframe MIPS consumption and provide recommendations to reduce the same.

Guntupalli Srinivasarao, an expert in mainframe optimization, was engaged to drive this assignment. He had collaborated with the client for another project through which he had developed contextual knowledge about the client’s processes, style of working, system landscape and expectations. He dedicated his time to learning, understanding the business and building his networks. Being aware of the needs of the client, he took it as a challenge to reduce operational costs for the client instead of just reviewing and implementing a consulting engagement. His capacity to make informed decisions in varied, dynamic, uncertain situations made him the ideal choice for this critical project.

To deliver on this, Srinivasarao and team collaborated with the TCS development and testing teams who were also providing ADM and testing services to the client. Being mindful of the work culture and their expectation of empirically backed solutions, Guntupalli Srinivasarao worked towards optimizing and testing the code along with data points on how much will the actual savings in cost be if the solution is implemented in production. This garnered immediate acceptance, and the solution was implemented.

Within three months of implementation, the client could achieve a savings of $1 Million. Jane was delighted with this solution since it addressed her initial issues and also made the client’s ecosystem robust enough to handle future problems.
The client also gave a favourable recommendation to one of TCS’ prospective clients, which assisted TCS to bag the deal. Within six months, $3 Million savings were realized and the same initiative was expanded into other lines of business in North America IT, APAC and EMEA regions.

What was supposed to be a 3 months engagement for 2 consultants resulted in 13 years of engagement to TCS, saving the customer over $140 Million which helped them fund other essential enhancements, and helped TCS generate a direct revenue of $13 Million

This program also won 2nd best TATA Innovista award in 2008 in North America. Such is the success of TCS Guntupalli Srinivasaraos that enrich the clients, TCS and their teams immensely.",Transforming Systems For Operational Excellence,Arindam Adhikari,Cards,OpEx,Cost & Optimization,Item,3

"John* was the Head of Compliance of a leading bank and a recent audit report showed that the bank did not meet the U.S compliance requirements on many fronts. He identified hundreds of potential data issues involving US Regulatory reporting that needed a timely fix and failure to comply would bring in a hefty financial loss to the bank in terms of penalties.

Much of this non-compliance was related to data governance and quality, which John felt had to be addressed not just to avoid penalties, but also to provide a loss of reputation among customers and stakeholders. After coordinating with the IT team, he came up with fixes that involved 500+ applications and 64 different teams across 4 lines of businesses.

It was a massive task for John and the entire organization to coordinate and accelerate the fixes without having functional experts across the teams who can identify the problem areas and fixes for the same. Plus, they had to look at applications that were outside the scope to make decisions and recommendations and this seemed almost impossible given the processes to gather the requirements from the various business areas was incoherent and non-standardized. Soon, John and the IT team realized it was impossible to do this task by themselves and also their existing resources were spending too much time and effort on this activity. So, they turned to TCS for help because of the long-standing relations between the two companies.


Deviparghavi Kaliaperumal who had a proven track record of delivering several complex and challenging projects for the customer became the first choice to handle the current crisis of the customer. Over the years spent with the customer, Deviparghavi Kaliaperumal had acquired a very strong contextual knowledge about the different lines of businesses, their operational models, and the overall organizational culture. This came in handy to set up a ring-fenced team to focus on the issue resolved within no time.

But implementing the solution was not easy for her. The uphill task was to bring both business and IT on the same page and drive the delivery on time while ensuring the fix was applied in the source system. To overcome these challenges, together with the ring-fenced team, Deviparghavi Kaliaperumal identified areas of short-term enhancements and long-term strategic objectives. She created an outcome-based proposal for a lean target state including data governance, process, and operational considerations. Leveraging TCS’s location-independent agile concept, she quickly mobilized cross-functional agile teams with business and corporate function representation. The agile teams diversified the issue resolution process into different pathways based on the types of data quality exceptions to support enhanced velocity, throughput, and delivery.

Within a few sprints, the customer was able to see a significant decline in the number of issues. Improved collaboration between IT and business also has resulted in establishing accountability and quality of information to be captured upfront thus improving operational efficiencies and optimizing the performance.

The client was extremely happy with the initiative as it bridged the many gaps in systems and helped the client to meet its regulatory compliances. Also, it maximized data availability and value through better data governance.",Maximizing Data Value Through Integrated Data Governance,SHAROAN Mohammed,Cards,Regulatory & Compliance,Growth & Transformation,Item,1
"John, a customer with the client, had financial troubles and thus had no other choice but to take a mortgage on his house. However, with his increasing age, he had found the process too complicated and difficult. Already deeply troubled, John started looking out for other options, which would simplify the process. The client, realizing that many such customers were looking for other options and found the process complicated, considered this a serious issue to be addressed.

The main change that the client wanted to reinforce was to transform the mortgage process to Agile. Scrub Teams were formed and the resources used by the teams were not clear on how to size the user story, what parameters to consider when committing the user story sizing and other complications. The client decided to migrate to Agile due to quick turnaround time and deliver functionalities to production in 3-4 weeks’ time as compared to the long waiting time in a waterfall development model.

The need for this move was that the mortgage service offered by the client was a worldwide stint. This meant that the process had to be quick, simple and effective. The waterfall development, however, had a long deliverable wait time, high effort in defect fix and high cost in fixing production issues. The Agile platform would make the process more adaptable and could comply with maintenance and regulatory standards. Learning that the client was interested in changing to Agile, TCS offered support for a smooth transition. Aligning the right resources for the scrum team and mitigating any delivery dependencies otherwise, would impact the client in meeting compliance and regulatory requirements.

TCS, being a long time trusted service provider stepped up and helped the client achieve the transition within the timeframe and made sure that there is no impact to the business. It also ensured that proper knowledge transitioned to the production management team to handle post warranty issues. With such a situation, TCS handed over the gears to Alok Kumar. Alok had been working with the Client for a long time, and had vast experience in business management and also had knowledge of how the agile development model works and what are the areas to focus for successful delivery.



Alok Kumar was working as a Business Relationship Manager covering the Mortgage Line of business. The initial scope was communicated by the client mortgage domain director and product owner. After getting the initiative scope, Alok worked with the product owner, scrum master, business analyst, tech lead, Dev team, testing team, production support team and IT project manager to oversee any gaps in the implementation processes and resolve the dependencies ahead of time.

This technological transition was a learning experience for the team. The digital document signature user stories got implemented and testing was also done. Everyone including the development TCS team, testing team, and clients felt a sense of relief, accomplishment, and confidence in order to move forward with the next sprints. This agile migration was one of the major steps in order to move towards a full agile development model for all future projects. The client stakeholders were very happy and appreciated the TCS team and Alok dedicated involvement in the end-to-end delivery process.

With this, TCS was able to help the client achieve a major target - Agile project compliance in the Mortgage domain keeping it aligned with other lines of business. The client was deeply impressed by the versatility and zeal of the team, which greatly contributed to the success of the project. The agile migration effort by Alok for TCS was one of the stepping stones towards achieving 100% agile compliance in the mortgage domain. With this implementation, the trust and belief for TCS by the client managers can only get stronger.

"John, a customer with the client, had financial troubles and thus had no other choice but to take a mortgage on his house. However, with his increasing age, he had found the process too complicated and difficult. Already deeply troubled, John started looking out for other options, which would simplify the process. The client, realizing that many such customers were looking for other options and found the process complicated, considered this a serious issue to be addressed.

The main change that the client wanted to reinforce was to transform the mortgage process to Agile. Scrub Teams were formed and the resources used by the teams were not clear on how to size the user story, what parameters to consider when committing the user story sizing and other complications. The client decided to migrate to Agile due to quick turnaround time and deliver functionalities to production in 3-4 weeks’ time as compared to the long waiting time in a waterfall development model.

The need for this move was that the mortgage service offered by the client was a worldwide stint. This meant that the process had to be quick, simple and effective. The waterfall development, however, had a long deliverable wait time, high effort in defect fix and high cost in fixing production issues. The Agile platform would make the process more adaptable and could comply with maintenance and regulatory standards. Learning that the client was interested in changing to Agile, TCS offered support for a smooth transition. Aligning the right resources for the scrum team and mitigating any delivery dependencies otherwise, would impact the client in meeting compliance and regulatory requirements.

TCS, being a long time trusted service provider stepped up and helped the client achieve the transition within the timeframe and made sure that there is no impact to the business. It also ensured that proper knowledge transitioned to the production management team to handle post warranty issues. With such a situation, TCS handed over the gears to Alok Kumar. Alok had been working with the Client for a long time, and had vast experience in business management and also had knowledge of how the agile development model works and what are the areas to focus for successful delivery.



Alok Kumar was working as a Business Relationship Manager covering the Mortgage Line of business. The initial scope was communicated by the client mortgage domain director and product owner. After getting the initiative scope, Alok worked with the product owner, scrum master, business analyst, tech lead, Dev team, testing team, production support team and IT project manager to oversee any gaps in the implementation processes and resolve the dependencies ahead of time.

This technological transition was a learning experience for the team. The digital document signature user stories got implemented and testing was also done. Everyone including the development TCS team, testing team, and clients felt a sense of relief, accomplishment, and confidence in order to move forward with the next sprints. This agile migration was one of the major steps in order to move towards a full agile development model for all future projects. The client stakeholders were very happy and appreciated the TCS team and Alok dedicated involvement in the end-to-end delivery process.

"John, an employee with the client, worked in the Call Service Department with AIX physical application and database server till 2017. However, there had been complaints with the effectiveness of the AIX servers. The client had been using 40 servers with no vendor support, leading to server outage to which was impacting the end-user satisfaction. Since all the data was embedded physically, space and effectiveness was limited as they were confined to entities like memory, hardware and RAM across 4 locations across North America.

With cramping in such limited resources, it led to the servers being frozen due to network issues in a particular location or overload in servers which causes latency in the application. It needed to migrate the application on the Linux server to make an application compliant and avoid the extra chargeback for 40 AIX hardware. TCS was accountable to meet SLA requirements as the application is completely owned by TCS. The migration required drastic changes in the application, Job shell/Perl scripts, and database to make Linux compatible. The solution outcome was to virtualize the Linux server in 2 datacenters.

Priyank Bajaj, an onsite coordinator of the CWS application and worked as a core developer as well. His experience and Customer connect helped to create a solution for the problem statement. He was also quick in highlighting that this was a good opportunity to migrate the application to Linux. Priyank took part in analyzing the system architect assigned for migration along with the Client Manager. He documented the high level and low-level design documents for migration. Initially, there were challenges in implementing migration because of zero documentation. As a part of the implementation strategy, he first reviewed all the scripts and code from AIX. He then migrated the application code and scripts compatible to Linux and performed a POC on development Linux environment to run application architecture same as AIX platform.

The POC, after presenting it to Customer and System architect, delighted the client. The migration resulted in the downsize in the number of application servers to only 10 from 40 in 2 datacenters (5 each) which made it easy to maintain. Using his expertise in Linux, Priyank implemented the client approved load balancer among 10 Linux servers to overcome overload and outage issues. After the implementation, there were no outages or latency reported in the application. This effort was highly appreciated by the customer because of the stability of the solution and gave a cost save of ~ $100000 USD annually to the client. This helped end-user satisfaction and saved financial costs for the client.

"John, the CTO of a leading bank in the USA, was attending the GITEX Global conference. He was impressed by the innovative solutions that companies were adapting to enhance their processes. After attending a seminar on Delivery Dashboard, it struck John that his existing infrastructure lacked a centralised system that contained all the data in one place. Also, there was no consolidated view of up to date build, delivery metrics, testing, and incident statuses. This resulted in a lot of time and effort spent on gathering data from different sources by development leads and BA, rather than focusing on their core work.

This ignited a spark in John, and the next day, he called the TCS deployment team, their solution partner, and expressed an urgent need to remediate the situation and suggest the best course of action. The TCS team proposed to create a dynamic Delivery Dashboard that would provide an overall summary view by-product, portfolio, region, and release. It would be a centralised system that stored all the data captured from the releases and could be used for data analytics in the future. The portal would also help the Senior Management to monitor the team's KPI and their end to end progress.

John was convinced and asked the TCS team to move ahead with the project. Upon understanding the task, Vijay Kumar was roped in as a contextual master to drive the project. This is because he had previously worked with the client and had gained in-depth knowledge of their business and IT landscape. Besides, he had a good understanding of multiple sources of systems such as JIRA, ALM, and IBIS Kanban. With the help of this acquired contextual knowledge, Vijay was able to implement the platform successfully.


Vijay knew that business users had to prepare different reports and data from multiple sources. So, to avoid the manual work, he came up with the solution to develop a universal system to support stakeholders and check their team progress like story grooming, task planning, and testing progress. Also, Vijay decided to provide API to integrate multiple data sources with the help of schedulers and to load the data up to date.

Next, the Delivery Dashboard was implemented to give a consolidated view of the data. It also helped to maintain the root cause analysis and do further impact analysis. Finally, Vijay used the latest technology like AngularJS and API, to integrate the different system data sources and stored them in the database. The complex and vast volumes of data issues were handled in the business logic and added in the scheduler to call the API.

Post-implementation, the client was happy with the solution because it provided a consolidated view of the progress, risks, and overall performance of the projects. Also, the project RAG status helped the stakeholders to focus on the key risk and plan for the mitigation to avoid any issues on the delivery. The overall view from the regional perspective and also by the release perspective provided the complete KPI and progress of the individual teams within the LOB. Moreover, the solution reduced the manual errors, and the latest real-time data could be extended for further impact analysis.

Overall, it helped various stakeholders with their weekly meeting efforts and reduced the time to prepare the deck. John appreciated Vijay's efforts and concluded this as the most significant accomplishment in the process improvement space, something that he has envisioned for several years. The successful development and rollout of this Delivery Dashboard paved the way for many new opportunities for TCS.",Delivery Dashboard Enables A Consolidated View Of The Data,"M, Mr. KARTHEKEYAN (Karthekeyan)",Retail Banking,Legacy Transformation,Cost & Optimization,Item,1

"John, the CTO with the client, was having problems with the existing consolidated IDs and in converting them into new Person Account records. There were several gaps and issues in quantifying namely creation of a new record type and in creating CCID contact records which was to be linked with Person Account records under the assumption that the conversion of the existing record type to a Person Account would not result in the automatic creation of a new record type.

The client had been facing the problem of the new contact records were not being created for CCID records, leading for more work to be done to ensure that only those CCID that were created post the release to be impacted which had a total population of ~21 Million records. The challenge further was to ensure that a contact record is available for all CCID records so that those can be converted into a Person account.

This caused a dent in the client’s business, as it had to be ensured that all data is ready for conversion. This will impact the retail sales force business if not completed correctly and successfully. The expectation is to have this conversion completed for all the eligible accounts/IDs. With the urgency of the situation, John contacted TCS who in turn handed over the project to Philip who had been working as a Data Analyst and also had a functional understanding of Business and had several years of experience in data analysis and transformational logic.






Philip had gained this knowledge via working for numerous Data demanding organizations and had ve been extensively working on various data transformational tools and technology to have them fulfilled. The innovative solution proposed by Philip was to ensure that the conversion CCID received is done flawlessly, and also the email was rolled-up at the Consolidated Client level. This solution also took care of Data syncing for populating the Previous CCID data populated once the Person account changes are made.

The success of the project was due to the ability of Philip to emphasize problem-solving and recognize the importance of thorough assessment prior to delivery. The challenge enabled him to apply his contextual knowledge also in designing the solution and effectively deliver the same. This experience enabled Philip to develop and assess his performance and also enabled him to foster a learning curve replicating his experience from the past necessary for delivering this project.",Building An Intrinsic Conversion Tool For Ccid Records,Arindam Adhikari,Retail Banking,Process optimization,Cost & Optimization,Item,1
"Jonas*, the CFO of a leading North American Investment Bank, serving EMEA Institutional customers in a Global Exchange, had to deal with a significant issue. It received 59 financial CAPS (Observations made in Corrective Action Plan) from an audit conducted by regulatory authorities, leading to 250 mm approx. the difference in P & L revaluation for legal entities across the globe. These observations had affected the company’s reputation in front of their customers. Jonas knew that he had to immediately close the comments and come up with a solution that saved their status from such substantial financial exposure and gained credibility within and outside the organisation. Hence, Jonas decided to partner with TCS to tackle complicated matter.


Pradeep Kumar Mohanarangam was an expert in the investment banking domain and worked as a Reconciliation SME in the Capital Market for the client for seven years. Therefore, he became an ideal choice by TCS to manage the finance come technology requirement of the client. Due to his previous engagement with the client, Pradeep had acquired in-depth contextual knowledge on client’s application landscape and had a thorough understanding of applications such as the client’s Transaction Lifecycle Management, EUROCLEAR (General Market application) and PPM (Payment Processing Module). Moreover, he was an expert in analysing financial products in addition to being a master in location-specific guidelines for financial institutions.
Pradeep quickly identified the issue in the current revaluation process. He realised that it was not adhering to the location-specific guidelines. The amount of data accessible from the clients across the globe was growing exponentially for various products, and their P&L varied from the region/country. So, as a first step, Pradeep used his contextual knowledge of the client’s IT landscape, upstream and downstream systems along with knowledge on regulatory requirements to create a detailed plan for clearing all 59 CAPS before the settlement date for each clearinghouse. He established a desired level of connectivity with all the stakeholders, including business teams. Pradeep and his team then conducted the uphill task of thorough data analysis for the large data file (~3GB, i.e. 20 days COB data). They identified the criteria by writing a complex & robust procedure and ensuring performance. Also, with the help of his rapport with the client business team, Pradeep was quick to identify the downstream impacts.
Pradeep and his team brainstormed and developed a step-by-step procedure to revalue the settlements to be presented to the business. Next, the revalued items were swiftly plugged in, interrupting the automated batch stream. The entire implementation thereby corrected the downstream applications with minimal effort. Lastly, the permanent fix was deployed to production at the scheduled time.

The conversion of 40 years old legacy platform ADARS (Asset Distribution Accounts Receivable and Sundries) of the client to the new Transaction Lifecycle Management (TLM) happened successfully through Pradeep’s efficient approach. It provided annual cost savings of ~215M with increased efficiency and reduced risk.

The overall solution was applauded by the client, and it saved a lot of manual efforts in reconciliation. It worked as a relief against manual calculations, which was like a nightmare for monthly settlements. Since the program was injected, 99.9% of the products were revalued automatically without a single P&L issue. Post-implementation, the fix ensured that no excess/deficit payments were logged into the client’s records.

"Judy* was staring at the computer screen one day at work with frustration and anger. She was heading the reporting team in a major global financial institution and was in charge of sending accurate reports about the performance of Service Level Agreements (SLAs). Of late, she had been under a lot of pressure because the data needed to create SLA reports was not coming in within the specified timelines and in turn, this was affecting the accuracy and submission schedule of her reports.

The client was a US-based financial banking entity that was required to create and submit reports according to the federal government rules. These reports were to show that the customers were not affected because of the recession. It also showed various risk factors, for example, customers not paying on time. The repercussions of not submitting reports on time included hefty fines.

Judy found it hard and expensive to get data from multiple raw data providers and there were data redundancies and confusions related to the data that came in, and this required back and forth communication which in turn, lead to delays. To top it, the data handling process required manual intervention that was error-prone and added to the delays.

After having a quick chat with the rest of the team, she decided it was time to escalate it to higher management. After she presented the facts of her case, the management decided to address it right away and to this end, they reached out to TCS.

Sudarshan Reddy Kompelli was given the task of leading this project because of his long-term association with the client. He had worked on many data processing channels in the past and so, TCS believed that he could pull off this one too. Above everything, his association with the client helped him to understand the different systems and processes such as cards data, warehouse and data marts, sources, and architecture. In the past, Sudarshan had setup the ETL environments by working with different vendors to meet the regulatory requirements of the organization and this had helped him to understand the company's vendors and the overall data flow.

With such in-depth contextual knowledge, Sudarshan began working on the project. He initiated discussions with multiple stakeholders to understand the definition of attributes and their significance and associated it with the underlying data marts to fill the gaps. Based on all this information, he suggested architectural changes and created various plans to remove unwanted layers, automate processes, eliminate unnecessary processes/steps, and improve the overall SLA. All this helped the client to avoid huge payouts to data vendors for multiple replicas of data and earlier than the current agreed time of data supply.

Eventually, the client was able to generate accurate reports within the specified deadlines and needless to say, Judy's job became less stressful.",Improving The Timeliness And Accuracy Of Sla Reports,SHAROAN Mohammed,Data Analytics ,Reporting,Cost & Optimization,Item,1
"KPG Bank is one of the largest banking and financial service providers in the North American region. KPG’s customer service application for credit card services, Sawgrass, is built using the Chordiant technology and uses both legacy (TIBCO) connections to mainframe and some next-gen APIs.

KPG’s teams consisted of a mix of both Agile and waterfall resources and maintained separate code streams and environments waterfall and Agile resources. With the client’s vision of completely transitioning over to Agile methodology, all teams were converted to Agile. However, with the newly formed Agile teams, there came the problem of how to manage separate streams and environments sustainably. With the prospect of converting the whole project team of over 70 developers to work in Agile, KPG struggled with creating code streams and environments for each Agile team being formed.

TCS has been a trusted long-time partner of KPG and provided them with delivery and maintenance services. Hence, KPG approached the TCS team for providing them with a solution for efficiently and smoothly transitioning resources into the Agile framework. With multiple backend sources like mainframe, CMR, microservices, making a common environment for all teams was predicted to be a mammoth task.

This was when Saravanan SD, the contextual master, was tasked with executing the transition. Saravanan was part of the team at the client’s end for more than 12 years and has an in-depth understanding of the design of the client’s systems and how they interacted with each other. Saravanan SD was assigned to lead this effort by TCS as a strategic partner.

His first priority was to gather information from various backend and middleware applications running on different environments. Saravanan proceeded to work with the internal build and deployment team to understand the current limitations of the system and realized that there were multiple applications that did not have a dedicated environment to run on. Saravanan conducted brainstorming sessions with various teams and proposed a solution that utilized the client’s Unified Testing approach. The Unified Testing environment enabled other applications of the client to adopt the solution as well.

Instead of using separate streams and environments for each Agile team, Saravanan’s solution utilized only two streams that point to a common Agile environment, facilitating multiple applications. The Agile teams would then use these streams based on the current sprint and upon completion of the sprint, the code would then be merged to the waterfall region and repurposed for a future sprint. This created a common environment that could be utilized by all the teams, enforced by the concept of aligning sprints with the proper environment and release. Saravanan’s solution helped the client reduce unnecessary server space and maintenance efforts of handling many environments.

Saravanan’s feats were greatly appreciated by the client. His solution did not require new infrastructure changes but instead took advantage of the existing infrastructure. The utilization of the Unified Testing approach also meant that the client did not have to bother about environment related issues.

"Kevin* wanted to buy a used car and accessed the website of a US-based Captive Auto Finance company to see his monthly auto payments. He realised that the site was not user-friendly, took a long time to load, and didn't give him the information he wanted. So, he moved on to another company’s website but made it a point to pen down his experience on social media.


The marketing and social media head of the company noticed this comment and sighed with frustration because Kevin was not the first person to give such negative feedback. Satisfaction of the company’s website users were decreasing, and it was becoming difficult to elevate the Web/Mobile customer engagement within the shopping funnel and retain the next generation of consumers through training to value cross-brand loyalty. Earlier, the management used to focus only on the backend systems. Hence, for new customers, the client was unable to provide purchase decision support through frictionless tools to influence their choice and propensity to convert, thereby resulting in a 15% loss in potential new customers.

Kevin's message had triggered a sense of frustration in the marketing manager, and he presented the facts to the senior management. When the management realised the gravity of the problem, they were shocked and decided to focus on the transformation at the front end level. Hence, they approached TCS.

Indranil Ghosh had been associated with the client since 2006 and knew everything about the client's business, systems, and problems. He was also a Subject Matter Expert in Omni Channel Consumer and Dealer Experience Design and Transformation and possessed in-depth experience in auto lending practices. Indranil had played a role of engagement lead for website technology uplift program and web payment redesign. He was instrumental in launching the first mobile web & mobile applications for the client. Indranil's domain knowledge in redesigning the consumer experience for several other auto lending customers for TCS emerged as the keys to the success of this program.

Loaded with such vast experience and knowledge, Indranil met with different teams within the marketing division and created a customer journey map and an integrated dealership experience and web/mobile omnichannel experience strategy. His rich contextual knowledge of client's business and IT landscape enabled Indranil in crafting a solution blueprint based on Adobe Experience Manager product suite. This supported the client to transform the experience quickly, and they could easily modify the content without any help from their IT department. Indranil gathered business requirements and created a framework architecture. Finally, the solution was implemented on a mobile-first approach, a single code base, and on-cloud applications.

Indranil collaborated with the TCS EAS team to provide a comparative assessment of various ECM (Electronic Content Management) tools which helped him to recommend Adobe Experience Manager to the client. Indranil's suggestion proved to be the lifeline that the marketing team was looking for, and after implementation, marketing campaign performance improved by 11% while customer satisfaction increased by 15%.

This success established TCS as the Digital Consulting and implementation partner for the client and the customer even agreed to jointly present this digital Journey with TCS at the next Adobe Summit, all thanks to Indranil. TCS' Business 4.0 principles, along with Indranil's contextual knowledge, helped the client achieve a best-in-class omnichannel customer experience.

He realised that the site was not user-friendly, took a long time to load, and didn't give him the information he wanted. So, he moved on to another company’s website but made it a point to pen down his experience on social media.


The marketing and social media head of the company noticed this comment and sighed with frustration because Kevin was not the first person to give such negative feedback. Satisfaction of the company’s website users were decreasing, and it was becoming difficult to elevate the Web/Mobile customer engagement within the shopping funnel and retain the next generation of consumers through training to value cross-brand loyalty. Earlier, the management used to focus only on the backend systems. Hence, for new customers, the client was unable to provide purchase decision support through frictionless tools to influence their choice and propensity to convert, thereby resulting in a 15% loss in potential new customers.

Kevin's message had triggered a sense of frustration in the marketing manager, and he presented the facts to the senior management. When the management realised the gravity of the problem, they were shocked and decided to focus on the transformation at the front end level. Hence, they approached TCS.

Indranil Ghosh had been associated with the client since 2006 and knew everything about the client's business, systems, and problems. He was also a Subject Matter Expert in Omni Channel Consumer and Dealer Experience Design and Transformation and possessed in-depth experience in auto lending practices. Indranil had played a role of engagement lead for website technology uplift program and web payment redesign. He was instrumental in launching the first mobile web & mobile applications for the client. Indranil's domain knowledge in redesigning the consumer experience for several other auto lending customers for TCS emerged as the keys to the success of this program.

Loaded with such vast experience and knowledge, Indranil met with different teams within the marketing division and created a customer journey map and an integrated dealership experience and web/mobile omnichannel experience strategy. His rich contextual knowledge of client's business and IT landscape enabled Indranil in crafting a solution blueprint based on Adobe Experience Manager product suite. This supported the client to transform the experience quickly, and they could easily modify the content without any help from their IT department. Indranil gathered business requirements and created a framework architecture. Finally, the solution was implemented on a mobile-first approach, a single code base, and on-cloud applications.

Indranil collaborated with the TCS EAS team to provide a comparative assessment of various ECM (Electronic Content Management) tools which helped him to recommend Adobe Experience Manager to the client. Indranil's suggestion proved to be the lifeline that the marketing team was looking for, and after implementation, marketing campaign performance improved by 11% while customer satisfaction increased by 15%.

This success established TCS as the Digital Consulting and implementation partner for the client and the customer even agreed to jointly present this digital Journey with TCS at the next Adobe Summit, all thanks to Indranil. TCS' Business 4.0 principles, along with Indranil's contextual knowledge, helped the client achieve a best-in-class omnichannel customer experience. Currently, Indranil is not only working as the Relationship Manager (Digital Portfolios) for this client but also assisting other accounts in TCS for essential Customer Experience Digital Transformation initiatives in Banking and Financial Service Domain.",Improving Customer Experience With The Right Tools,Mohit Goyal,Automative Finance,Digital Transformation,Growth & Transformation,Item,1
"Know Your Customer (KYC) is a process for Customer Identification in which customer’s risk and financial activities are accessed to comply with Anti-Money Laundering (AML) regulations. The client was the credit card division of a multinational bank based in the United States and had operations across the globe. The client was using a manual process to sync KYC data through bath processing. As the batch processing was executed from various source systems, it resulted in duplicate entries. The data discrepancies in the system were resolved through manual data entry and this was proving to be a major operational issue delaying the entire process. The client was unable to cope up with the delay and failed to comply with the KYC regulations. Since the problem had a larger impact on the business, the management started to focus on solving the KYC issue as the top priority. John Harper, the IT manager in the credit cards division was made responsible for finding a solution.

The credit card division of the multinational bank had KYC agents who tracked all the KYC documents via multiple touchpoints through SharePoint sites, spreadsheets, and internal/external systems. The entire process was cumbersome, error-prone and time-consuming. Agents also had to change ownership manually that resulted in some KYC being lost. Real-time reporting on the status and communication to the Relationship Managers was lacking as everything was sent via email. This resulted in delays and the client often failed to comply with the KYC regulations. TCS had been working with the client for years in development and maintenance projects.






The client approached TCS to provide a single source system through which the KYC agents would be able to view and update the KYC data in real-time. The client wanted TCS to build an automated workflow and business process management tool to prioritize, track and support KYC reviews. Their target was to build a tool using Pega comprising 250 KYC cases within 3 months. TCS identified Mohammad Ziauddin who had been working for the Client for 8 years as the Contextual Master (CM). Over the years, Zia had acquired a deep understanding of the client’s business processes, their KYC process, client’s operating model and the IT landscape. On multiple occasions, Zia had demonstrated his ability to drive complex projects to success.

As a CM for KYC project, Zia started his journey by having a series of discussions with the Business and Operations teams to understand the challenges of migrating the legacy system to the new tool. Zia ensured that his team of developers were experts in Pega and he motivated them throughout the journey. Zia helped in channelizing the requirements so that development and testing can work simultaneously. Parallelly, he also worked with the infrastructure team to set up the environments and provide user access based on the client’s security policy. During the project, Zia focused on improving the visibility, prioritization and systematic controls within the process to provide an enhanced user experience and compliance. He provided feedback and was in constant touch with his Business Analysts, testing team and development team so that everyone was in the loop and transformation could be done seamlessly.

The implementation of the KYC tool in 2019 by Zia and his team was a great success. The client realized an upward trend in metrics like customer experience, controls, visibility and efficiency. The client was happy to see an addition of 200K new cases through the new Pega tool and the migration of 57K legacy cases to the new tool. Client forecasted an annualized benefit of as $7.1M for 2019 and $9.4M for 2020 due to the implementation of Pega tool. The client was happy with the KYC tool that it was extended for other LOBs too.

"Krishna was the Sr. VP heading the Default Servicing Unit for one of the Big Four Banks. His company was facing issues with foreclosures as they were not meeting the SLAs. Attorney firms were involved in liaising between the lending institutions and the Judiciary, whenever a defaulted mortgage came to the foreclosure queue. The Attorney firm’s paralegals were dependant on the account information provided by the Operations team. Due to the lack of necessary information, the responses for critical information requests from the attorney firm were delayed impacting the foreclosure timeline and an increase in service costs. Over a while, certain loans that required immediate attention did not show up in the queue which made Krishna reach out to TCS for help.

Praveen Balaji was one of the Delivery Managers at TCS and had worked for 7+ years in the mortgage domain. He took the initiative to address Krishna’s compelling issues. Krishna explained the criticality of the situation and also laid down his requirements. Krishna wanted all the critical messages received from the paralegals to be tagged as ‘Required Read’ and prioritized. The tag was to indicate the Operations team to prioritize any related questions posed/information sought by the paralegals were important/urgent and attended to immediately. Any delay in response would result in a breach of SLA. Addressing the issue would reduce the undue delays in the foreclosure timelines and thereby a reduction/nil penalty due to SLA breach.


Praveen analyzed the communication between the Operations team and paralegals amounted to 20,000+ messages on a given day and acquiring the required/important data became very critical. He also analyzed the delays during different stages of the cycle and conceived a solution that could be implemented as a part of the Lean exercise. Parallelly, he also got to interact with the reports team and access their Report Builder tool used for generating reports. Praveen realized the data required for his assignment could be extracted from the Report Builder and decided to build a report-specific. The analysis also revealed the paralegals when missed to mark the messages as ‘Required Read’, pushed the messages to the bottom of the workl ist.

Praveen shared his solution idea with Krishna, who welcomed it immediately. As the final solution, Praveen implemented a Control report with a macro written to extract the important messages that were incorrectly/mistakenly tagged. The report was checked daily to ensure all the important/critical messages were read and responded to explicitly.

The solution was appreciated by Krishna and his team. The solution saw a decrease of 54% in missing critical messages and mitigating the possibilities of SLA related penalties.",Macro Driven Control Report For A Quick Response To Messages,Mohit Goyal,Loans,Reporting,Cost & Optimization,Item,1
"Lisa* was working in the credit cards department of a leading global bank and one of her tasks was to use the risk manipulating tool to evaluate the risk factor in different managed segments. Typically, she had to upload an excel file to manipulate the count and download the processed file for verification. Though it sounds simple, in reality, she faced many issues because of the varying formats in the excel file, especially related to date format and data type. Sometimes, she was not even able to upload the file due to these errors, which in turn, impacted the ability of the department to assess the risk factor of an applicant.

She escalated these issues and since this was an important tool, the concerned managers decided to find a fix for it right away. To this end, they approached TCS, and Rajmohan was brought in for this project because he had been working in the team right from inception and had a thorough understanding of the underlying IT systems. Also, he had played a key role in the design and development of this risk manipulation tool and hence, knew the functionality and existing flow well.

At the outset, he knew that the challenge was to validate all the data in a file. Totally 9 files were used to upload the data, with each file containing around 25000 records, each record approximately 50 fields, each field having different data types like string, number, and date. If the file contains any invalid data or was not in the correct format, then the system showed the generic error message in the UI from which it was almost impossible to zero in on the problem. The only way was to check every column manually with some trial and error. This was time-consuming and effort-centric.

As the technical lead of the Risk Management application, Rajmohan and his team were responsible for checking the data type of a field in each file and checking the data type of each field in the database table. Instead of this roundabout way, Rajmohan came up with an easy solution, which was to store all the validation errors in the database table and export to excel when the user needed to check the invalid data in the file. It also pointed out the column name and row number where the invalid data had to change.

Since the master table stored the column name and its data type for validation, all that he had to do was insert the column name, data type, and column index fields also in the master table.

As for the workflow, the validation was done after uploading a file, so the system read the excel data and stored it in a list. Next, it got the list of columns from the master table and stored them in a list as well, after which it validated the field value from the excel list with data type and stored it in the master table. This way, if the validation failed, then the column name and row number were stored in the error table and the system moved to the next data for validation. If the file passed all validations, it was uploaded. Otherwise, the user could download the error report, correct the invalid data, and upload it again.

This simple solution made it easy for Lisa and her team to fix the errors and their productivity increased as well.",Implementing Error Tables In Risk Management,Subramanian Balaguru,Cards,Process optimization,Cost & Optimization,Item,1
"Louis* was the IT Head of a large and well-renowned banking institution and credit card issuer in North America, with a global presence. His company was committed to perform a major portfolio migration from another banking institution. Stringent timelines, countless hours of meeting, and massive backend changes were some of the challenges faced by his team, to achieve the commitment. With such a large bank, the core was built in homegrown applications in legacy software. The migration program demanded many architecture changes across the entire application.

One such change was needed in one of the critical legacy applications that held the demographic data for all the Credit Card customers of North America. Louis was well-aware that the backend file structure had to be modified as a part of the requirement, and that was unavoidable. Being a legacy system, it was very complicated to make architectural change. The major hurdle was that this application was never changed since its inception from the ’80s. Louis was worried as the in-house capabilities were not at par to manage the hurdles of the application and thus, approached Ambika from TCS for her expertise in resolving the company’s issues.

Being an SME, Ambika Mohan had the extensive technical knowledge, that she gathered by being an integral part of the TCS family and the client for more than 13 years. The first step towards devising a suitable solution was to meticulously study and analyze the complexity of the system. Ambika identified that the system was more complex than what it seemed to be with over 84.2MM executions per day, interacting with various legacy and digital applications.

Ambika understood this situation and formed the core TCS team to work with her towards the solution. She conducted various scales of analysis with her team to decipher the solution. Being with this client for these many years and owing to the role she played, Ambika molded herself into a Contextual Master and this helped her to impeccably draw a well-planned solution. She carefully formed a core TCS team to work with her, and drafted a very detailed design, carefully making sure no stones were left unturned. She met with SA’, BA’s, and various application directors, and presented the proposed solution along with Louis.

Ambika and her talented team worked tirelessly round the clock to deliver what was committed to the client. With such tremendous hours of proposed changes of 6000 hours, the production push was well orchestrated with a controlled rollout. Thus, Ambika was able to deliver the change in production seamlessly. This was applauded by Louis and all the various application teams that were impacted by the change. It was Ambika’s Business and Technical knowledge combined with analytical skills that helped her in arriving at the solution.

"Many of the more than 7,500 internal users of a financial services corporation had written into the tech lead, Jonathan, complaining about the significantly longer time it was taking them to log into the RSA Clear Trust application with their Single Sign On (SSO). The remaining users complained that their login transactions were failing. Fearing that external users, too, might soon begin to experience these issues, Jonathan asked the support team to look into the matter on a priority basis. However, they reported that they could not identify any specific discrepancy through which the root cause could be identified.

The internal organization users were experiencing slowness intermittently while the issue went unreported for the external users initially. Since TCS provided the corporation AMS support, Jonathan asked it for help. The consultancy brought in Chandrasekhar to step, identify the issue and offer a solution. From the get-go, Chandrasekhar knew a couple of facts. First, the RSA Clear Trust application had been in operation for more than ten years.


Second, since its vendor support was on the verge of expiring, they could not be expected to resolve the issue. That wasn't not all. As part of the same project module and AMS support team, Chardrasekhar also had a deep contextual knowledge about the client’s existing architecture and application details, server behavior, service and project change management. In fact, he had been involved in all major upgrades and application upliftment activities. He was also aware that an RSA Clear Trust server addition was done to distribute the load within multiple servers and add a Federated SSO tool called RSA FIM.

Beginning with a deep-dive analysis of the SSO stack, Chandrasekhar some of the applications were too old to be migrated to a new version due to web server/app server /operating system incompatibility. He also uncovered that the list of contexts – done by extracting data from Active Directory – was much higher than they ought to be. This involved collecting issues and occurrence time from internal and third-party users and comparing all the data with the server logs. Thanks to his deep contextual knowledge, Chandrasekhar realized this was because old data was in the AD server. Each context was consuming 4 KB of space for authentication, which was why responses were getting impacted.

With the root cause found, the solution presented itself to Chandrasekhar. The active directory count needed to be limited, and leveraged for authentication and authorization. To test his theory, he removed unused context roots -- identified through query and removed from admin interface -- for a particular application, and saw that this improved logging in time by 50 percent. With proof at his disposal, Chandrasekhar presented to the client two suggestions. They could either add additional Active Directory servers to distribute the load to improve login response time, or they could remove unused contexts from the Active directory to achieve the same result.

"Maria was a diligent senior manager of a leading US-based state-chartered bank. By the year 2018, she realized that it was high time that her company must deploy the best project management tool. Maria knew that the Salesforce team lacked a proper project management tool; by which they faced various challenges in the project such as requirement gathering, work assignment to the respective teams, reporting of the project status, and so on.

Also, in the year 2019, the license of their test management tool was getting expired. Maria didn’t want to renew the tool due to its very high cost and less usability. Hence, the team was upset about losing all the important testing artefacts. Because of not having a reliable project management tool and the sun setting test management tool, the project got delayed in moving to production. It became a struggle to manage the project timeline and deliverables. On top of all these, the upgrade of the test management tool made the situation even worse for the testing team. TCS was a strategic partner to the client, and due to the existing scenario, they had to perform all the project management work manually using the excel spreadsheet.

Along with that, the TCS testing team had to use a very amateur test management tool that made them go through multiple iterations. Maria identified that even importing the test cases into the existing tool was a failure, and there was no scope of creating the automation regression bed from the functional test scripts. The dashboard also was too confusing; hence it was critical for the bank to implement a project management tool and an effective test management tool. So, the TCS team assigned Chaman Das as a test analyst for the Salesforce support and maintenance program, due to his seven years of working experience with the client’s business. Chaman had a total of 8+ years of experience in the IT and banking domain.

As he was already using Salesforce in the project as the CRM tool, he thought of leveraging the tool with his contextual knowledge to solve all the client’s project and test management issues. This would also extend the utmost features to the bankers and quality analysts in the team. To accomplish his motive, Chaman collaborated with the TCS practice team and built an application inside the Salesforce tool named as Project Universe. With the application, the client was able to create different releases, document the requirements and map them with the release; build story cards and auto-assign them to the stakeholders. Additionally, they were able to create a dashboard to have a chart view or the Kanban view of each individual requirement; make utilization for each team member, and have the production deployment component details on the requirement.

Finally, an efficient project management platform was extended to the client with no extra cost. Chaman created another tool inside the Salesforce to replace the legacy test management tool and achieve all the testing related activities in a better way. It joined the Project Universe application that resulted in a more robust system, recognized as a single place for all the development and testing activities. This solution saved a lot of time for the Quality Assurance team; every action plan was executed in the Salesforce application.

"Mark heading the IT department in a major Global Bank was assigned the responsibility of a major CRM transformation program. The bank had a huge presence in North America. The existing CRM implementation in the Bank was fragmented. These applications didn’t integrate to provide a smooth Customer Centric experience. A customer holding multiple relationships with the Bank was treated only at an Account level and not at Customer level. Because of multiple vendors and complex architecture in these implementations, the result was a fragmented CRM implementation at the individual Line of Business level with very low interoperability. With the changing Business needs and Customer expectations, the bank was at a verge of losing Customer Satisfaction.

The challenge was to build one Global CRM, coordinating with multiple Data Sources and build a Customer 360 view for the CRM users. Mark wanted to include implementation of Salesforce CRM in Retail bank, Credit Cards, Mortgage and Commercial Bank. Due to Leadership change in the Bank and their priorities switching towards Customer Centricity, multiple programs running in parallel were put on hold. Mark approached TCS who were already engaged with the bank to identify a solution to fix the Fragmented CRM implementation.

TCS was expected to provide a solution for this multiple CRM problem understanding the challenges posed by the current Bank Ecosystem. Kasirajan was the TCS head for the Bank’s Customer Management Domain. His association with the bank of over 14 years gained exceptional contextual knowledge of the Bank’s Ecosystem. His knowledge in leading Salesforce CRM delivery both put together made it natural for him to lead this strategy initiative to build a road map for this transformation.





Kasirajan took up the role of the Strategy and Delivery Lead to devise a road map and plan for the execution of this major transformation program. This had to be done with no major impact to the business, within a budget and strict timeline. He set up a small SWAT team with the experts from account team, salesforce practice and banking domain experts. He initiated a 3-day workshop with participants including both customers and TCS members. He was able to document all the vision and the client’s Value proposition in a detailed way. Post this workshop, a detailed road map for 2.5year long was created for the Customer to achieve the task of Org consolidation of the CRM application. This included release level chunks tagged with Customer Value Proposition in terms of growth, retention and cost save. Kasirajan worked on creating a strategic plan in creating exponential value for our customer and to customer‘s customer by applying the key pillars of the TCS Business 4.0 strategy like driving mass personalization, leveraging ecosystem.

Mark was very satisfied with the output. TCS were earlier considered as only a delivery partner. The CRM program helped them positioned themselves as a strategic advisor not only to the Customer’s IT organization but also to their support group like PMO, Business Analyst and also to the most critical Business Partners. Through this major strategy driven innovation exercise, TCS received more projects for the next 2.5 years to do an Org consolidation and CRM enhancements for the bank",Title Pioneered Crm Delivery For A Global Bank To Build Customer Centricity Through Business 40,SHAROAN Mohammed,Retail Banking,Process optimization,Growth & Transformation,Item,1
"Mark, the CTO of a leading bank who used Mail Management System as a centralized architecture to process Customer Statements, Letters and Plastics creating Intelligent Mail Barcode (IMB) and provide mail tracking capability and Address cleansing options, was facing trouble in sending, SLA files on time, as there was a delay in the validation process. This validation process was done manually by selecting the particular file in question and going through it in the validation server, subsequently, a follow-up mail is also sent.

However, this process was delay prone as it was done manually, and had delayed the consequent processes, which would lead to postal fines. Similarly during SIT/UAT phases of projects, The client needed the files sent to the vendor for print and inserting testing. However the team received 100s of files everyday and only selected files sent for specific project validation to the vendor therefore the team could not setup an automated transmission for all the files.

The client worked with 3rd party vendors for project testing and production files validation. The aim was to reduce dependency on the manual process and automate for speeding up the process and increasing productivity. However, this meant the tool had to be on standby 24/7 as there was no way of knowing when a SLA file needed to be transferred. Therefore, the solution had to be self-sufficient. Sensing the technical complexity of the project, TCS asked Arumnkumar to steer the project into success.

Arunkumar had been working for the past 9-10 years learning the end-to-end business process and had understood their day-to-day activities, and then could thereby identify the areas that needed improvement to achieve higher efficiency in the current process and increase client satisfaction. With his vast experience, Arunkumar could sense the risk involved and decided that the solution must be self sufficient which should be able to function without causing delay in the process and restrict the access to a limited group of people. This problem was solved by creating multiple schedulers to retrieve the data from the self-service tool and run in the backend almost real time to reduce any delay.

The solution proposed by the team was to create a new self-service tool integrated with Single Sign on (SSO) allowing the users to request any file transfer to the client’s validation server for their Business validation or transfer to the vendor for print and insertion testing, without any human intervention. The challenge was to build a Front end GUI to get user inputs and invoke the set of backend codes to get the file transferred to the corresponding location. Sufficient analysis was carried out to build and implement the tool and covered all possible validation scenarios that require the file transfer to different vendors. Technologies like .NET, Oracle SQL, Perl, Shell and Autosys schedulers were used to build this new tool. This automation process resulted in Cost savings of around ~50k per annum to the client.

This enabled the client to access the files at any given time. The tool worked real time and could send an automated email with the status of the request which helped the client with their validation process. This displayed Aruns versatility and proficiency in the field, leading to many praises and accolades.",Building An Automated Selfsufficient Tool For Mail Management System,"M, Mr. KARTHEKEYAN (Karthekeyan)",Cards,Automation,Cost & Optimization,Item,1
"Martin was the CEO of an organization based in the USA. His Project Management and Reporting team were using MS Excel and PowerPoint historically to create all the dashboards, metrics and KPIs. His team catered to different geographies, each Excel or PPT often ended up with 20+ pages and the team had to maintain many of these. Creating and maintaining these dashboards were taking a considerable effort and huge disk space to store them.

Martin realized that with his expanding business, continuing to use the legacy solution would become a threat. He requested TCS to provide a solution that would be digital in nature and aligned with TCS Business 4.0 model. TCS aimed to address key components like availability of data at any time, ease of access, minimal storage requirement, interactivity of dashboards and metrics.

Jinit was working with the client for the last 11 years and was well aware of the requirements. This experience and knowledge of the client’s focus area helped a lot in designing new dashboards that promptly addressed the focus of the business.

Jinit worked as a reporting lead from TCS and was involved in the reporting process since day 1. He found out that an interactive dashboard solution would be the best fit to address this existing problem. With his contextual knowledge of the business, he set up some cases which contained the key metrics used by different geographies.






After evaluating multiple digital applications, Tableau Desktop and server were identified as an optimum fit. Tableau Desktop was interactive in nature, dashboards and metrics for multiple geographies could be built in a single tab with an interactive filter. Tableau had live drill up and drill-down capabilities. Tableau also enabled business users to see data as per their requirements. The 20+ pages in PPT used earlier could now be presented in a couple of Tableau dashboards. Dashboards were published in Tableau servers, so removed the requirement for SharePoint altogether. Understanding the requirement and sentiment of the client, helped Jinit to create effective dashboards in a minimal timeframe.

Once implemented, the client was impressed to see the flexibility of the new application and ease of use. Interactivity was the added advantage which made the solution more attractive. Tableau servers could be accessed easily from tablets/mobile, which multiplied the ease of access.

Jinit was thrilled with the new solution which started from scratch and was well accepted by Martin. He was all praise with this implementation. TCS management also appreciated Jinit as this opened a new channel for further improvement for the legacy reporting process. This resulted in a new Tableau Team for TCS and more tableau migration requests.

Project Management and Reporting team of Client willingly agreed to replace their legacy process and embark on a digital journey. For TCS, it is also an opportunity to find new business growth.

"Martin was working for the IT division of a leading bank playing the role of Technical Lead for Payment solutions. Martin’s team had built a new cross border solution named ‘Worldlink’ to its end customers for providing a convenient, reliable and cost-effective way of making payments to the countries around the world in the local currencies of the destination countries. The new solution was launched first in Hong Kong in 2019.

The bank faced a major challenge when the end customers wanted to add additional transfer currencies in the system as per their business needs. For each new transfer currency added to the system, it required Martin’s team to develop additional code and test the system before it was deployed in production. This caused a delay in launching new transfer currency in the system and thereby impacted the revenue of the bank. The client was a banking organization well established across all ASIA and EMEA countries.

Whenever a new currency was added to the ‘Worldlink’ system, the Payment Initiation screen was required to display a few dynamic fields applicable to the new destination currency. This required development of code for adding dynamic fields for the new transfer currency. The code required to be tested for SIT/UAT with all the business validations before moving to the production. Since this delayed the process of launching a new transfer currency, Martin wanted a solution to quickly launch the new currency as and when required by the customer. TCS was part of the payment client’s solutions team and they too felt the pressure of working on tight schedules when a new currency was added to the system. So TCS decided to help Martin’s team to find the solution for the dynamic fields issue.

Saravanan Thirugnanam who worked with the client for 7 years was appointed as the Contextual Master (CM) for the project. Saravanan was the lead designer of the ‘Worldlink’ payment solution. He had strong contextual knowledge on the modules of the client’s application and was capable of designing an optimal/high-performance solution. Saravanan Thirugnanam, along with technical expert Jasleen and onsite counterpart Muthu analyzed the problem in detail and also held discussions with the client teams.

After analysis, Saravanan’s team designed a solution where all the dynamic field details for the new transfer currencies were configured in the database tables. The team also built a front-end Configuration screen for the client to configure the dynamic field details. As per the solution, when the customer selected a transfer currency in the Payment initiation screen, the dynamic fields were displayed based on the details stored in the database tables. The team introduced a Turn on/off DB flag which helped the customer to show or hide each currency and its dynamic fields. The dynacache time interval was also configured in the framework for the DB changes to reflect automatically in the front-end without the need for code deployment or a server restart.

Saravanan and his team successfully implemented the solution which went live in Jan 2020 in few countries and in Apr 2020 in few other countries across EMEA and Asia region. The solution helped the customers to seamlessly roll out new transfer currencies by supporting dynamic fields without the need to deploy the code package. This also averted the risk of frequent code changes deployed in production leading to production issues. The solution helped the client to generate a revenue of 31.85 MM US dollars. The client management immensely praised Saravanan and his team for the world-class solution that enabled easy addition of transfer currency in the system. The solution helped TCS to gain the client’s trust and business continuity.",Adaptable Design To Support Dynamic Fields For Worldlink Payments,SHAROAN Mohammed,Cards,Digital Transformation,Growth & Transformation,Item,2
"Mathew* was the head of the IT Finance team for an auto financing institution in the US. He was in a meeting with the finance team and a few auditors of the company on a very serious matter. The finance team had a huge loss in property tax payments during the first quarter of 2019. Since this company is the owner of leased vehicles, it was responsible for paying the property tax though these payments were passed on to the lessee based on eligibility criteria. But the process to assess the taxes on eligible lease accounts and sending the bills was a manual process that involved many parties and was cumbersome, to say the least. Due to this huge manual process, many eligible lease amounts were written off due to errors and delays in processing and this was the reason behind the huge property tax payments that the company had to shell out.

Mathew had been under fire from the senior management for this loss and he decided the best way forward is to automate the tax processes to reduce time and human errors. After getting the necessary permission, he decided to outsource it to TCS as he had been working with the TCS offshore lead Rajalekshmi for the past two years on various projects. She had a good experience in the banking domain with a very good understanding of the legal and compliance requirements of such assignments as well as the technical expertise to complete this task.

After receiving the request from the customer, Rajalekshmi did a quick analysis of the requirements and she understood the criticality and urgency of the task on hand. With many years of experience in handling such mammoth tasks, she decided to pull in her strong offshore development team for the assignment and explained to them the nature of the tasks and the tight timeline. Also since the customer is a financial institution from the US region, strict adherence to CCAR rules was a must. Rajalekshmi's contextual knowledge helped her team to quickly understand the situation and systems, and start work right away.

During the entire assignment, she regularly contacted the client's finance and compliance team and took the necessary inputs required for the development of this solution. Her strong technical background helped the team to complete the automation within time and with the highest quality. The single file processing which used to take 8 hours earlier was reduced to a mere 15 minutes while the review and reporting process which used to take 2 days was now a 1-hour process.

This automation project was a huge success for Mathew as it removed manual processing errors and helped his team to save money on property tax by sending the right bills to the lessees within the given timeframe. Mathew was relieved and he knew such a huge error could never happen again!

"Matthew, a loyal customer of a leading bank, had missed communication for several weeks from the bank about his credit card statements. Therefore, he was looking out for alternative options. This problem was due to the fact that The bank has a manual process of re-issuing the plastics or letters for address change requests for credit cards ever since they were introduced by the company in the mid-’90s.

With a growth in the number of customers, the bank saw that the credit cards/letters that were sent to the consumers were getting bounced back to the bank in huge numbers. This was called ""return mail events"". The bank executives had to directly contact the customers to get the right customer addresses to send credit card/letters. However this method of manually contacting the customers was inefficient, and the bank executives contacted TCS for a viable solution.

He had set up a wide range of discussions with TCS architects and The Chief Product Owner over the implications of the issue and possible solutions. The solution needed to be approved at several levels and Phanee attended various conferences to get it cleared.






Phanee, being a Scrum Master was actively involved in the flows in the manual process and prepared the flowchart. He made sure that all dependencies have been taken care of and an automated returned mail process for sales practice artefacts identified which have been returned undeliverable as well as regenerating specific communications where an updated address has been provided.

"Max was part of the team that was introduced to the Salesforce platform in 2018. The idea was to manage customer relationships in a very efficient manner. Even though the platform was successful in managing the relationships, it could not perform full-blown customer and account servicing in call centers. This was due to the absence of a customer authentication framework. The call center users continued to use multiple disparate legacy applications to perform customer and account servicing and use the salesforce platform only to view the customer.

Max worked for a bank which provided services to the clients via Consumer Banking (for Individuals), Institutional Banking (for Corporates). Though the client made the platform available for the end-users, the current authentication framework was too big. So the call center users continued to use the authentication framework in legacy applications leaving the Salesforce platform grossly underutilized for servicing. Additionally, the users were worried about being left out of the new customer authentication programs getting implemented in all legacy applications and not in Salesforce, making them further reluctant to use Salesforce for servicing. The business was considering the option of building a new app from scratch specifically dedicated for customer servicing, which would have cost very big spending to the tune of more than a million dollars.

TCS had been supporting the client for application development and maintenance for quite some time. It had to identify teams with varied skill sets to support the Salesforce and legacy applications. With a possible introduction of a new application for customer servicing, it would have added to the complexity of maintaining a diverse support team from TCS. From the client's point of view, it would have incurred a significant additional expense to build a new application and initial investment and vision of implementing Salesforce remaining unrealized. This required thorough analysis and strategy as to how to leverage and integrate all the disparate applications including Salesforce platform to provide a business with the ability to service the customer in Salesforce and creating a roadmap for the return of investment on Salesforce.


Pramit Mishra, the contextual master, has been working as a business analyst, technical lead, application lead and designer for different servicing and call center applications. Additionally, he has been the team lead of the Salesforce development team for over a year. These experiences helped him to understand the possible integration points across different applications. Pramit was also able to understand the challenges the users faced to manage multiple applications for service.

Pramit could understand the importance of using the salesforce platform for customer servicing and the immense value it could bring to the call center users in terms of managing the customers. He conducted a series of analysis and proof of concepts to integrate the customer authentication framework of legacy applications with Salesforce. This enabled the Salesforce platform to service the customers without building any additional components. It simply leveraged the existing AND future implementation of authentication framework of legacy applications by integrating a variety of applications like IVR, Softphone, Web applications, desktop applications and the Salesforce platform. The understanding and agreement from the business operations on the design approach further helped Pramit to fine-tune the design.

Pramit proposed a design to create WebSocket components on desktop applications and leverage the full-duplex communication feature of WebSockets to exchange information across different applications on the desktop of Call center agents. He knew how to create WebSockets in desktop applications and leveraged that knowledge to create communication paths among legacy applications and Salesforce platforms.

Additionally, he has been the team lead of the Salesforce development team for over a year. These experiences helped him to understand the possible integration points across different applications. Pramit was also able to understand the challenges the users faced to manage multiple applications for service.

Pramit could understand the importance of using the salesforce platform for customer servicing and the immense value it could bring to the call center users in terms of managing the customers. He conducted a series of analysis and proof of concepts to integrate the customer authentication framework of legacy applications with Salesforce. This enabled the Salesforce platform to service the customers without building any additional components. It simply leveraged the existing AND future implementation of authentication framework of legacy applications by integrating a variety of applications like IVR, Softphone, Web applications, desktop applications and the Salesforce platform. The understanding and agreement from the business operations on the design approach further helped Pramit to fine-tune the design.

Pramit proposed a design to create WebSocket components on desktop applications and leverage the full-duplex communication feature of WebSockets to exchange information across different applications on the desktop of Call center agents. He knew how to create WebSockets in desktop applications and leveraged that knowledge to create communication paths among legacy applications and Salesforce platforms. After implementation, the customer authentication information from legacy applications started flowing seamlessly to Salesforce, thereby removing the dependency to build any customer authentication framework in Salesforce",Optimal Utilization Of Salesforce With Smart Solutions,SHAROAN Mohammed,Retail Banking,Legacy Transformation,Growth & Transformation,Item,2
"Michelle was used to the mammoth number of accounts held by her company. She worked for one of the leading banks in America. They had over 200 million end-user accounts and conducted business in more than 160 countries and jurisdictions. In the 1960s, they entered into the credit card business and evolved their line of credit all over North America in a wide range. Apart from 24x7 customer service availability and online service quality standards of 99.997%, they also dealt with Debt Forgiveness Processing, where 1099C is an IRS form sent to account holders who meet certain requirements regarding Debt Forgiveness/Cancellation.

A sequential file of eligible 1099C recipients was sent to Dallas Information Reporting Group (DIRG) in a predetermined format. DIRG would use this file to produce the 1099C forms. The files were reviewed, edited, and reconciled in preparation for the year-end tax filing by the Recovery Process Excellence team. Files were sent to Financial Reporting Operations (FRO). FRO/RSSI / Transaction Services processes, prints, and mails copies of the statements to customers as mandated by the IRS. This was the recurring process happening in each financial year.

Also, the DIRG would use this production file to create W-9 request letters for accounts with an invalid SSN. Collections would again apply the Customer Service transactions to note the accounts which were sent a W-9 request letter from the January production run. The 1099C forms had to be printed and postmarked to the cardmember no later than January 31 of the year immediately following the current tax-reporting year. Otherwise, the client would be subject to fines. Being their service partner, TCS had to be involved in the process mentioned above and create a smooth solution.


Ezaz, the nominated contextual masters, has been associated with the client’s collections application for more than seven years. She had a good understanding of the application and had acquired her knowledge in all the functionalities. She used her contextual knowledge subject matter expertise to perform the detailed analysis of IT systems deployed and provided her solutions to resolve the issues and fix the problem. This analysis helped her to establish an end-to-end process and identify the gaps in the existing process.

Ezaz understood the process being done by the TCS to support the client in their Debt Forgiveness Process. Every year, the application had to run a certain series of jobs manually to accomplish this process. A manual effort was needed from both TCS and the client, to run this process, verify the data and final file to the DIRG team. Ezaz decided to automate this manual process as a solution.

Ezaz provided an idea to schedule the series of jobs required to run for the process. Instead of running the tasks manually, it could now be scheduled in an application in production and the application can be demanded whenever required. Due to this, the manual effort was reduced, and only less effort was needed to validate the final data before providing the file to the DIRG team. Also, the team had provided the file to the DIRG team early when compared with the previous years.

With this automation process, the recurring manual effort of 25 hours was saved, and the team could now utilize this manual effort in other deliverables.

"Monica Stallone was employed as head of the IT department in one of the leading financial services companies based out of North America. The group services included Banking, Insurance, and investments. The client had a presence in over 160 countries spread across six continents. The company managed 200 million customers with the strength of 300K employees. The company management looked upon Monica to find a solution that would improve their productivity which was essential to stay competitive.

TCS was a key service provider for the client and one of the critical services included quality assurance. Monica requested TCS to support her cause. Manohar Reddy CH had an extensive understanding of the client process and systems involved. He had immense contextual knowledge about North America Legacy Testing and Quality Assurance processes. He also had vast experience in the financial domain. TCS entrusted the responsibility to Manohar to lead the client’s initiative to enhance productivity.



Manohar had worked in many roles in the client’s environment such as that of a Quality Engineer, Analyst, Test Coordinator, Quality Manager, and he had led many projects and had contributed in a big way to improvements in the client's operations and business. He started to explore the areas to save costs and time for the client.

In the current Test Environment, the batch ran once in two days with 1 day of Keying window, 8 hours of Batch time, and 16 hours of verification in sequential order. This was leading to increased test cycle time for certain scenarios and also delaying conditioning of accounts for most of the real-time and batch dependent scenarios. Moreover, agile teams were lagging in having enough batches to cover their testing. So Manohar decided to explore options for reducing test cycle time and increase the time to market

He explored many options and found an optimal solution to run a daily batch in a test environment using 123/ABC files similar to production to achieve 24x7 of Keying/Verification window which reduced test cycle time enabling speed to market

By analyzing various data points such as number of batch dependent scripts, number of cases depending on conditioned data, number of batches needed to condition each scenario, number of user stories which were being spilled over to next sprint, Manohar came up with an idea of accelerated (or daily batch) batch which could provide solutions for the above said pain areas. He came with an accelerated batch using both 123/ABC files replicating the production environment, and this saved 50% of the test cycle time in each release. Manohar then prepared a presentation and arranged a Demo to Monica and her team. He explained the solution with statistics and benefits. Monica accepted the solution and nodded her approval to proceed with the implementation.

The client immediately noticed the benefits of the accelerated batch and was impressed by this out-of-the-box idea. Manohar was well-appreciated for thinking through this area. After implementing a daily batch, test cycle time got reduced and increased the time to market.

This solution further strengthened the bond between TCS and the client, resulting in bringing more business for TCS.",Mainframe Modernization Batch Acceleration,"MRJ, Mr. SABAREESH KUMAR (SABAREESH KUMAR)",Cards,Legacy Transformation,Cost & Optimization,Item,1
"Morgan was the director of the human resource division in a leading banking financial company. Every time there was a strategic HR meeting, he would find the data reported to be inadequate to make any informed decisions. On discussing with the HR team, the members came up with the pain areas they were experiencing. The team had to use the legacy manual process for data analytics and reporting. It was a tedious process of data transformation, analytics and reporting. The data from various sources had to be collated manually and there was no single platform hosted for seamless creation of analytical/predictive models for the data.

The client is a leading US based banking financial company. Until September 2018, the client was using the legacy process to generate the analytical reports for HR data. This involved long work hours and inefficient way of reporting HR data causing a lot of hassles to the workforce. This was also impacting the end users as the updated data was delayed every day. The need of the hour was modernization of the platform moving away from the legacy systems. The client’s top management was looking to solve the issue by implementing a strategic Data Lake solution.

Being a strategic solution partner, TCS was engaged in building a Hadoop Data Lake for integrating HR data into a single Hadoop platform. TCS was prompt in appointing Sajib Dutta as the man in charge. Sajib has 13 years of experience in Data transformations, Mergers and Acquisitions in the US finance industry. Sajib’s in-depth knowledge on the client’s application, Big Data, Data security and Hadoop ecosystem made him the perfect choice to spearhead the program.

Sajib played a Technical Lead role in the HR Hadoop Data Lake project. His knowledge on Big Data and experience in handling data transformations helped him in planning and creating execution roadmaps for the solution. Sajib’s first priority was to fine tune the existing analytical operations by simplifying, optimizing and automating the process. Having good knowledge on Hadoop ecosystems, he was able to leverage the features such as scalability, sustainability, resilience and performance of the platform. Sajib involved TCS consultants with expertise on various platforms like Big Data Hadoop consultants, Data visualization SMEs and Microsoft Power BI experts during the implementation of the solution. The Power BI experts were engaged with the HR team for analyzing the analytical reports and to form an HR Analytics requirement repository. During the development phase, Sajib used the domain functionality of the HR modules available in the market (like ADP, Hyperion).

The HR Hadoop Data Lake implementation by Sajib’s team helped the client to automate HR’s employee data reporting, include BI capabilities on HR data analytics, perform sentiment analysis of bank’s employees, modernize the appraisal process, automate the scheduled processes and availability of organization hierarchy data. Further, proper utilization of Hadoop technology stacks helped in building the complex transformations easily. Sajib’s solution made life easy for the client HR business users, data scientists and the senior management.

Sajib’s team was showered with accolades from the client’s leadership team and the project success was indeed an additional feather in TCS’s cap. A key appreciation note came from the Chief HR officer of the client praising Sajib’s dedication and talent - ""Congratulations on bringing the Client HR Data Lake to fruition. Standing up to this capability is a monumental achievement that will have a lasting, transformative impact for Human Resources and the entire organization. Your efforts, as part of a diverse team, epitomize the best attributes of our culture and our LEAD core values"".

Not just that, the success of the project could be witnessed in the form of fruitful metrics. This project was estimated to be a 200K USD project and TCS Account level revenue grew by 5% due to this program.",Data Lake Solution For Hr Analytics,SHARMILEE PRAKASH,Cards,Reporting,Growth & Transformation,Item,1
"Murphy as the CEO of an international bank was on the journey of setting a new path for his bank by introducing an adaptable installment payment option for eligible customers to have an edge over the competitors. The bank was one of the largest in the world with a plan to establish a partnership with a leading e-commerce company. Murphy collaborated with a 3rd party vendor and according to the agreement the bank was responsible for developing a product within a short time.

The development of a product though sounded simple, had a lot of intricacies involved. To begin with, there was a lot of data to be exchanged between the bank and the vendor, detailed unit testing and system integration testing, vendor-specific testing, and NDM connectivity testing, all while maintaining data privacy. With a tight deadline to be met, Murphy brought in TCS for support in design, development, and testing.

As per the process set by Murphy, all the activities right from development to delivery were to be done offshore. Only a Process Engineer from the bank would be assigned to provide support at the application level and it would be TCS’s sole responsibility of delivering the product. Srinivasa Lalithaprasad (Prasad) was assigned to the complicated and critical project, as he had 12 yrs of experience with Mainframes. Prasad’s initial analysis revealed a whopping 2M customers who came under the eligible criteria list.
Prasad began with setting up of processes that included identification of eligible card members for the program, sharing data with e-Commerce vendor in an encrypted format, development of the new process in the bank’s application, daily data exchange with the vendor, and tracking eligible customer database and sharing with the vendor.

Prasad and his team prepared the design document with the help of the set processes. The initial design was discussed in detail with Murphy and the respective stakeholders who gave their nod to proceed further.

"Nathan, the general manager of a global financial services company, had to upgrade the existing functionality of the bank to cope with the boom of digitalization. He knew that this upgrade would increase customer experience in managing credit card statements or payments compared to physical statements. The senior management took an initiative to upgrade their account online functionality with the fusion system. This initiative would reduce costs in physical statements and encourage their customers to use digital statements.

Nathan spoke to the IT lead and learned that the Fusion digital system demanded an additional statement format (CSV) Comma Separated Values. The existing functionality had online PDF statements where (AFP) Advanced Function Presentation statements were loaded to a backend storage system, on-demand System. Since the existing account online system did not have the CSV functionality, changes had to be made at the traditional mainframe process to convert AFP statements to CSV statements. The first phase of transition was done with the Customer Revolving Credit (CRC) account holders. However, there was a gap formed in handling these AFP formats at Fusion front end systems converting to CSV formats. The client turned to TCS for assistance.

TCS has been the technically sound partner for major projects for the client. They had to come up with the process and define the infrastructure/software for running the process. Alagu Srikanth Marimuthu was roped in for making this project a success. He has been working with the client since 2008 and worked directly onshore for 5.8 years. He was well versed with the technical knowledge and knew how the applications worked together. With strong technical and application knowledge, Srikanth was able to provide multiple solutions to the problem.

Srikanth had multiple calls with the client and the Fusion team to do basic planning. He faced issues in getting experienced resources with AFP and CSV knowledge. His team worked with the offshore teams to gather more AFP and XML knowledge and to set up an environment for the new process to run. Since Srikanth was aware of the existing process for all portfolios, he was able to easily come up with the conversion idea and other resources required during the transformation process.

Srikanth discussed with his team members in segregating the CSV statements. He came up with XML (Extensible Markup Language) formatting that would be converted to CSV formats based on the XML tags. With his knowledge in Cobol programs and on demand loading formats, Srikanth separated the statements files into XML tags that could be converted to CSV. He created a new table at the on demand folder and accounts were generated in XML formats with Cobol XML Parser at Mainframe.

Srikanth’s team knew that XML formatting to on demand folders and files were not easy to be loaded on demand. They came up with the idea of indexing to determine the start and stop of the XML statements. However, while testing with different languages, Srikanth found that some of the French characters couldn’t be differentiated with the XML. He loaded to mainframe UNIX folders. He downloaded the formatted file from Unix back to the mainframe to get the indexing values for these foreign characters. Nathan and the senior management were impressed by Srikanth’s successful migration and implementation of FUSION CSV statements. The client was delighted by an overwhelming experience on the new digital platforms and appreciated Srikanth for his implementation.",A Flawless Functionality Upgrade With The Help Of A Successful Migration,SHAROAN Mohammed,Cards,Legacy Transformation,Cost & Optimization,Item,1
"Naveen was working for a leading multinational bank with its presence across the globe. The bank was using an older version of IBM mainframe software which was due for expiry by mid-2017. The software was built with multiple complex and critical applications and was used by 20m users daily. During 2016, Naveen the IT Engineer tried to upgrade one of the programs to a newer version Thamotharan was aware of the bank’ without conducting adequate testing. The code was migrated without testing that impacted the production of many users leading to the severity 1 incident and halting the migration. The new version of the software seemed to require a detailed impact analysis and a thorough unit testing before migration.

Naveen was challenged with a very tight deadline of 7 months and had to meet the migration requirement without an impact to the 20m users, at any cost. Naveen approached Thamotharan who was associated with the bank for over 14 years and over the period had served in various capacities as Developer, Technical Lead, Architect, Delivery manager and was an SME for Cards. Thamotharan was aware of the bank’s application landscape, complexity and production implications. Together with TCS’s Mainframe Centre of Excellence Team Thamotharan came up with a foolproof migration plan. He then prepared a detailed analysis and testing proposal customized exclusively to comply with the bank’s existing scenario. Thamotharan submitted the SOW for approval to Naveen.


Naveen was happy with the proposal and submitted it to the Sr. Management. After review and discussions, the SOW for $760k was signed for the complete software migration within 7 months. After winning the deal, Thamotharan donned the role of a Program Manager and worked along with the Mainframe Centre of Excellence team to analyze the new compiler options and fixes to deal with the issues that could arise during migration. He followed the phased migration approach – Pilot, non-core and core.

During the pilot phase, few specific critical components were identified to detect the issues during migration and subsequent resolution. Using the Pareto analysis, Thamotharan resolved the majority of issues. (The solutions derived during the pilot phase helped deal with the issues during non-core and core phases of migration).

The non-core phase covered the medium complex components and the core phase covered the remaining critical components. He then prepared a detailed testing plan to complete the unit and integration testing for the critical components. As the final step, all the components were migrated to the new version within 7 months. He also coordinated between multiple stakeholders to ensure seamless migration with the agreed deadline.

Naveen and his team were happy to witness the migration to the new version without any setbacks.

"Neal was part of the IT support team of a US-based global bank. The bank, with operations in retail, cards, and banking utilized several applications for each of its Line of Business (LOB). To ensure these applications functioned smoothly, and to prevent any outages and subsequent customer impact, the critical application and technology layer was monitored intently.

Neal's team was in charge of maintaining the organization's SLAs and reducing MTRS. However, considering the size of the business, it was getting difficult to manage everything manually. The team's reaction time increased drastically as the business flows and number of applications ballooned. TCS had a long-term relationship with the client. Souvik Sen, from TCS, was working with the client as part of the production support team. He had faced the same issues that Neal's team was going through. Since his team's mandate was to maintain specific SLAs, he understood that automation was required to manage the activities. This would help both TCS and the client optimize their resources and invest them in other critical areas.
He further realized that the recent digitization exercise carried out by the client would only increase the complexity of the technology layers and would increase customer impact if left unchecked. He understood that there was a need for a strategic tool that would aggregate all the incoming events from different systems to detect/predict failure.

Focusing on the digital channel, he started building a tool that would capture the health of all vital services and would notify the stakeholders with an alert in case of any critical issues. The information would be captured and presented in an easy to understand dashboard. Utilizing several technologies, he built a tool called Automated Management of Production (AMP).

"Neal was part of the IT support team of a US-based global bank. The bank, with operations in retail, cards, and banking utilized several applications for each of its Line of Business (LOB). To ensure these applications functioned smoothly, and to prevent any outages and subsequent customer impact, the critical application and technology layer was monitored intently.

Neal's team was in charge of maintaining the organization's SLAs and reducing MTRS. However, considering the size of the business, it was getting difficult to manage everything manually. The team's reaction time increased drastically as the business flows and number of applications ballooned. TCS had a long-term relationship with the client. Souvik Sen, from TCS, was working with the client as part of the production support team. He had faced the same issues that Neal's team was going through. Since his team's mandate was to maintain specific SLAs, he understood that automation was required to manage the activities. This would help both TCS and the client optimize their resources and invest them in other critical areas.
He further realized that the recent digitization exercise carried out by the client would only increase the complexity of the technology layers and would increase customer impact if left unchecked. He understood that there was a need for a strategic tool that would aggregate all the incoming events from different systems to detect/predict failure.

Focusing on the digital channel, he started building a tool that would capture the health of all vital services and would notify the stakeholders with an alert in case of any critical issues. The information would be captured and presented in an easy to understand dashboard. Utilizing several technologies, he built a tool called Automated Management of Production (AMP). This tool could be integrated with any source system and would display the holistic performance of the different digital channels.

Not stopping there, he created a data lake that would utilize a prediction model based on data analytics and machine learning to generate historical trends. These trends have helped the support team to prioritize real-time issues. The client appreciated Souvik's solution and praised the initiative of the TCS team. Both TCS and the client benefitted from the reduced customer impact duration and increased resource utilization resulting from the solution.

"On a Wednesday morning, Yuvaraj from TCS had some free time. So, he decided to go to the canteen and have a cup of coffee. He was part of the Decision Engine rules application team working closely with the TCS onsite team of a leading bank in the US. While taking sips of coffee, he started thinking deeply about the client problem areas that he had overheard during meetings.

The Business Rules Decision Engine System consisted of multiple control tables where they maintained logic and strategies. These tables were shared by many Lines of Business (LOB) and were differentiated by unique client ids. However, for each business request, these tables had to be modified and installed in production. The main issue was to retrofit the tables as per the change request. As a result, there were many cases when incorrect tables were updated and loaded into production. Also, the right client tables were updated & tested correctly, but the wrong client was loaded during the install. There were times when the system treated the delinquent customer by placing them in the best queue as part of a mitigation plan and assigned the best communication channel to reach the customer eventually leading to severe business impact. Besides, regression testing was required to be performed for all LOBs. This led to an increase in the number of days required for installing a particular change into production. Also, there was a need to validate non-updated LOBs during testing and post-implementation process.

With TCS reputation at stake, Yuvaraj started brainstorming on different ideas that would address the client's problems effectively. As a technical lead, he had a good exposure of working closely with the client for more than seven years. This gave him an understanding of the Decision Engine application and the architecture of the connected systems. Besides, Yuvaraj was well aware of the client's business and IT landscape. With the help of this acquired contextual knowledge, he was able to modify the architecture of the existing systems successfully.


At the start, Yuvaraj started analysing as to why there were multiple test requests for a change to test run. Based on this information, he understood that the problem was to accommodate all decision areas from control tables to the Blaze system without affecting the current outputs. So, Yuvaraj gained knowledge about the Blaze advisor tool and how the system was designed. With the help of this knowledge, he removed all control table concepts which stored the strategic decision information. Also, he asked to place all the control table vital information in blaze code, which could be utilised by the developer to make changes to both rule and strategy all at one place. Upon implementing the suggested solution, there were accurate strategic recommendations without having high severity table issues.

Post-implementation, the client was happy with the solution because it eliminated the extra effort required to make the table updates separately. Also, the developer was able to handle both strategy change and business rule change at the same time. Overall, the system looked like a generic centralised straightforward model. Further, it eliminated the usage of licensed control table software, which led to $200K savings. The solution also helped reduce redundant testing, retrofit issues and resulted in smooth implementations. The client appreciated Yuvaraj's efforts which paved the way for many new opportunities for TCS.",Business Rules Development Using Coding Engine And Implementation,"M, Mr. KARTHEKEYAN (Karthekeyan)",Commercial Banking,Legacy Transformation,Cost & Optimization,Item,3

"On a cold November night in Seattle, Vanessa left her office around 8 pm and went to a pizzeria to grab a quick takeaway. She used her credit card for the purchase, as usual. Next, she headed to a gas station, where she realised that her credit card was missing. To avoid any fraudulent transactions, she immediately called up the credit card service provider and got her card blocked. However, as both her credit card and account numbers were the same, the latter was also blocked. This was one of the challenges that numerous customers of a leading credit card service provider were also facing.




Meanwhile, a large US-based retailer, which operates a chain of membership-only warehouse clubs, was looking to end its long-term relationship in issuing co-branded cards with the aforementioned credit card provider. Another renowned credit card company had won the deal to port the cards, while retaining the original features. They also had to address the major challenge of providing customers separate account and credit card numbers so that situations like Vanessa’s could be avoided.
The client’s IT team studied the task at hand and realised that there were two different IT platforms – one for personal customers and the other for commercial ones. It was found that the commercial IT platform was more suitable for issuing the new services. However, the business was not willing to take up this work.

That’s when TCS came into the picture, and Premraj became the face of the programme. He had an extensive knowledge of the consumer and commercial credit card IT landscape and credit card onboarding and servicing value chain. He and his team proposed a comprehensive solution that had a flexible architecture in terms of generating distinct card and account numbers.
Premraj and his team put in dedicated effort and carried out a seamless implementation. The updated IT architecture allowed the bank to incorporate all the requirements within the framework with less efforts. This also enabled the bank to add new features/reward systems. The client’s business team was thrilled with the solution.

Months later, when the headline ‘Top credit card provider completes one of the single-largest portfolio conversions in history’ flashed on the news, Premraj and his team knew that their contextual knowledge was instrumental in designing a solution for the mammoth acquisition. Premraj’s deep knowledge about the client’s credit card ecosystem played a pivotal role in helping it find a solution for a challenge that baffled even experts.

The real breakthrough came when more customers started pouring in to get the new co-branded credit card because of its additional features. More than 1.6 million new accounts were opened, 45% higher than the client’s best record. Sales were at an all-time high at $100 billion.

"On a cold November night in Seattle, Vanessa left her office around 8 pm and went to a pizzeria to grab a quick takeaway. She used her credit card for the purchase, as usual. Next, she headed to a gas station, where she realised that her credit card was missing. To avoid any fraudulent transactions, she immediately called up the credit card service provider and got her card blocked. However, as both her credit card and account numbers were the same, the latter was also blocked. This was one of the challenges that numerous customers of a leading credit card service provider were also facing.




Meanwhile, a large US-based retailer, which operates a chain of membership-only warehouse clubs, was looking to end its long-term relationship in issuing co-branded cards with the aforementioned credit card provider. Another renowned credit card company had won the deal to port the cards, while retaining the original features. They also had to address the major challenge of providing customers separate account and credit card numbers so that situations like Vanessa’s could be avoided.
The client’s IT team studied the task at hand and realised that there were two different IT platforms – one for personal customers and the other for commercial ones. It was found that the commercial IT platform was more suitable for issuing the new services. However, the business was not willing to take up this work.

That’s when TCS came into the picture, and Premraj became the face of the programme.

"On a fine Friday evening, Chris was sipping coffee at a local café. He was unable to find peace as he faced a pressing challenge at work. Being the customer relationship manager of a multinational bank, he had to make changes with the AFP file processing to accelerate the process. An eDelivery application was used for AFP file processing. He noticed that this application used to take a very long time to split and send email statements to customers for a file. This consisted of at least 200k customers’ information. He got in touch with the tech lead of the bank to learn more about the ongoing situation.

The tech lead told that the application used a UNIX command to split the AFP and store it in the pdf into the server. After the splitting was complete, it picks pdf files one by one and sends it to the customer sequentially. This process took around eight hours to complete. The client used to receive huge files during month-end statement processing, which was becoming a time-consuming job for the customer support teams.

Chris understood the gravity of the situation and had to think of a way to reduce the time and accelerate the processing speed. The bank was also concerned about physical space consumption. Since they did not have anyone who possessed the contextual knowledge to overcome the situation, the client bank sought help from TCS.

Chris expressed his concerns to TCS and requested them to make the process parallel and less time-consuming. There were very few people who knew Scala programming. Therefore, the bulk job of technical design and implementation came to Sanjit, who has been working as an SME in this area for the last few years. He had a sound knowledge of UNIX, AFP file processing, and Scala programming.

Sanjit did an extensive analysis of the existing implementation of FSM and Scala Akka implementation. He discussed with the tech lead and Chris and came up with an approach of parallel processing. Sanjit and his team did a demo of technical design and presented it. The design looked feasible to the client and they gave the go-ahead to start the full implementation.

After mid-2018, the new parallel AFP processing moved to production with a huge load testing in lower environments. During the month-end, it processed huge AFP files containing around 200k customers in just 2.5 hours. This process was done without occupying the physical file system. Chris was dumbfounded with surprise when he saw the fruits of the solution. His worries had vanished into thin air. He thanked Sanjit for his efforts and implementation.

The implementation was done in a short time without any ready references and with the use of new technologies. This had a great impact on the customer which boosted the TCS and client relationship. Later on, TCS implemented this approach in all regions gradually. Currently, all countries of APAC, EMEA, NAM, and Mexico regions are using this approach. Sanjit’s successful implementation received a huge appreciation from all business and technical teams of the client.",An Implementation That Accelerated Afp File Processing,SHAROAN Mohammed,Cards,Process optimization,Cost & Optimization,Item,1
"On a late Friday evening of November 2019, Andre, the CFO of a leading U.S bank summoned Roger the Bank’s Risk Assessment Team Manager for an urgent meet. This was regarding the identification of any suspicious fraudulent activities or loopholes as the bank had to bear losses of approximately $14 million in just 15 days. Roger, without any delay, called upon his team members to scrutinize as many of the latest transactions as possible. After a detailed check, the team noticed that there were several Credit Transactions in the range of $90K each originating from the Corporate Clearing House channel, which didn’t have valid Debit Settlement accounts.

The bank handled a huge volume of transactions from Retail and Corporate clients. Corporate clients could initiate Off-Us Credit transactions to another bank’s account and Debit the transaction on its account. To safeguard the accounts, a Hold used to be placed on outgoing credits till the debts were settled. Roger’s team discovered that fraudsters had figured out a bug that removed the hold for specific amounts (< $100K) when the transactions were initiated at a certain time of the day. Using this timeframe, fraudsters could withdraw the amount from another bank and flee. By the time the bank realized that the Debt Settlement account wasn’t having sufficient balance, one fraudster had already completed 14 such transactions of around $95K each amounting to $14 million. The bank had to clear off this amount from their books.

Hence, Roger, with the approval of Andre, updated TCS, their preferred partner for around 17 years, about the major issue. TCS TCS was involved in the critical funding path and managed the Retail Clearing House Transaction Processing application of the bank. It received the debit leg of the Corporate Originations and handed it off to the posting systems. In parallel, the Corporate Originations sent the credit transactions to another application, managed by the bank, for placing the holds. This application had a bug that dropped off the Holds for specific amounts leading to debit transactions being cleared downstream.

Sumeet, being the best choice, was placed by TCS as the SME for this application. He had been working in the BFS industry for the past 12.5 years having worked with leading European banks before this client. He had extensive experience in working for the Clearing House related applications for the past 8 years and had been managing Requirements, Design, Development, and Production Support activities for this client. He had worked on numerous projects involving the NACHA Rulebook and REG-E regulation changes interacting with various stakeholders of the Clearing House.

The Operations Team had started enquiring about the Unresolved Return Transactions coming on the Debit accounts. All these transactions had a predefined company name belonging to the Corporate System which did not get returned with ‘Insufficient Funds’ for more than 2 consecutive days. On further discussion with the Risk Team, the bug in the Hold Removal process was identified as the root cause of the problem. On deep diving, Sumeet suggested that an Alert Mechanism also had to be put in place in the Clearing House application. As per the U.S. Regulatory Policy, corporate customers’ rejected transactions had to be retried for 2 days. A process to generate an email Alert report to the Bank’s Chief Risk Officer and ACH Operations Team was set up within 1 week until the Hold Removal Process was fixed. Since most of the client operations worked on Mail Alerts, TCS’s solution of sending immediate reports over the mail fast-tracked the Trapping process.

Post-implementation, significant amounts of dollars were saved for the bank in the form of losses along with the reputation of protecting their customer’s money. The solution was highly appreciated and recognized in the Customer Town Halls. This episode certainly increased TCS’ ever shining reputation of being a preferred and trusted client partner.",Fixing The Hold Removal Process,Dinesh Jindal,Cards,Process optimization,Cost & Optimization,Item,1

"On the surface, everything about a popular US mortgage company, seemed fine. It was famous, offered varied products, easy repayment schemes, and excellent customer service. Behind the scene, however, Mike, the IT head, knew there were bumps ahead. Because the state of company’s data, the holy grail in today’s digital world, was dirty.

The senior management hadn’t complained yet, and why would they? The technical team did a stellar job of acquiring the data and keeping the company ahead of competition. This same data helped the company improve its work in sectors like risk management, property intelligence, and customer service, etc. But for Mike, it was difficult to come to terms with the fact that the data is unstructured and spread across multiple sources. He knew this would soon impact decision-making negatively and make the information retrieval process tedious, time-consuming, and challenging.

Mike preferred erring on the side of caution, so rather than wait for the founders to find the messy state of affairs, he decided come up with an automation solution that would make the information retrieval process faster. His scheme of things also included processes that would help the company understand patterns within the retrieved data so decision-making could be quicker. It was a grand plan, so Mike wasted no time in getting in touch with TCS, one of the oldest vendors of the company.

After going through the project details, TCS engaged Senthil Arunachalam to lead the project. Senthil was chosen because he was a veteran who had been with TCS for more than 16 years. In this time, he had worked on and delivered many mission-critical initiatives in the BFSI domain. He also had in-depth knowledge of Machine Learning (ML) and Python and had used this expertise to improve data quality and time-to-market in various projects.



What was to Mike an uphill task was a cakewalk for Senthil. After analyzing the problem areas, Senthil implemented machine learning models for document classification across all LoB. This improved the accuracy from 40 percent to 80 percent. His solution also doubled information retrieval accuracy from 35 percent to 70 percent. Senthil automated the tax file analysis from unstructured data, which enhanced its volume by to 25-30 percent. And because Senthil believed in delivering more value than promised, he went ahead and built a machine learning model that could detect anomalies in seconds.

Senthil’s AI-powered automated business processes were highly appreciated by the client. The solution helped the team handle the increased workload, made the time-to-market quicker, and enhanced data quality enough to meet all the critical business needs of the company.",Automation Solution For Faster Information Retrieval,Arindam Adhikari,Mortgages,Automation,Cost & Optimization,Item,5
"Online banking and Auto dealer finance were the main lines of business of a leading bank holding company. The bank did not have a fixed methodology for Customer Information and Analytics and Global Risk Compliance. The bank was following its own way of implementing solutions without having any proper direction or timeline. Furthermore, for any small change in business rules, code deployment was unavoidable. This caused system instability, causing revenue loss in millions. Due to this, the vision of having a unified customer base was diminishing as each LOB has its own customer repository. One of its vertical “Customer Information and Analytics” had an existing customized Master Data Management(MDM) application used as the golden repo of customer demographics across the LOB’s, to provide a 360 view to its various online applications in each line of business, the marketing teams, to call centers and others.

TCS was roped in as a strategic partner, to facilitate this modernization journey. Experienced personnel in end-to-end implementation of micro-services with the security facet of API gateway using the Red Hat camel Fuse in the open-shift platform was the major challenge for TCS. TCS recommended the agile Scrum way of Methodology by bringing in more Scrum Masters and Product Owners.
Praveen Nair, from the Accounts team, played a key role as Scrum Master and Technical Delivery Manager, to formulate an organized structure for deployments and introducing the Scrum Framework, which would save millions to the bank in terms of time management and resource management by efficiently producing a world-class product in less time. The productivity of the team increased enormously and the frequency of product deliverable increased as well. Praveen also helped the team migrate to the new tool for user story management from the primitive tool, thereby saving a lot of time and money for the bank. In order to solve this solution, TCS sponsored a CMS Scrum master certification to associates which enormously helped leverage the Scrum Master experience for building the scrum framework across different teams. It also helped to get an insight into how to build a Scrum Framework depending on the need of different industries and provide a solution based on the client's needs.






This implementation led to unified customer demographics with enriched demographics attributes fulfilling each business unit's needs. Forming individual scrum teams and bringing in the Scrum structure unified the teams and the agile framework brought in a culture of team collaboration and efficiency in delivering a quality product every two weeks. The scrum framework also brought in a work-life balance between associates thus increasing the productivity of the team. This project was a milestone for TCS.

"Our teams working for one of the largest captive finance companies in the US were facing a unique problem; they were grappling with an ever-increasing number of tickets that remained unresolved despite many hours of work. Most of these were raised by the Customer Service Representatives (CSR) of the client organization and were related to the issues faced by the end-customer, and the technical challenges faced by the CSR team.

This issue was denting TCS's reputation with the client and it was escalated by the client many times in leadership meetings. To address this problem and to bring down the number of incidences, TCS brought in Chandrani Shome as the Service Delivery Manager. She had been with the client for many years and had a clear understanding of its workflows and processes.

She started with a thorough analysis of past data, based on which she grouped the available data from earlier months into various applications, types of the problems reported, and so on. Then she put up empathy maps for the support personnel and end-users after many rounds of discussions with them. Her contextual knowledge of the client's environment helped her to quickly identify the right teams to contact and she brought them together to brainstorm solutions.

After thoroughly understanding the end-users' needs and challenges, Chandrani guided the support teams to go through a mind-mapping session where associates put their thoughts on the whiteboard. It became apparent that the teams were working more so in silos and were not looking at the interconnected applications. From her thorough knowledge about how the applications were integrated, Chandrani was able to bring in the right teams together to draw out the pain areas. Once it was found that many problems could be resolved if the whole environment was taken into consideration instead of single applications, Chandrani and the teams worked to arrive at different solutions. Challenges came up in the form of third party vendors for certain applications. However, these were discussed in detail and Chandrani collaborated with everyone to resolve these tickets.

These efforts paid off as the count of problem tickets decreased from over a hundred to just twenty, within a quarter. The client was extremely appreciative as the CSR employees could devote their time to more productive tasks. It valued this innovative approach, which helped immensely in reinforcing our relationship with the client.

"Over time, there have been various evolving tools, technologies and processes in quality assurance that have benefitted enterprises, employees and end-users with an increase in productivity, cost reduction and in predicting demand for the future. However, for the client - a leading BFS company, completing an Automation test case validation without manual intervention was a serious challenge. Preparation and assignment for test data to each test scenario were considered herculean and Ajay, the IT Head of the company was responsible for incorporating automation in their testing protocols.

Preparation of Automation suite set up and test data readiness were carried out as 2 separate entities. While identifying test data, it was imperative to consider multiple variables for each test scenario which was a scrupulous effort for Ajay’s team. Joining these two pieces opened a wide range of opportunities in Quality engineering like paving the way for piloting the CICD approach. Thus, realizing the need for an expert, Ajay reached out to TCS Business Relationship Manager to find a better Automation framework with a flawless handshake of test data between backend tables and the Automation engine.	

With Senthilkumar Balasubramanian’s 13+ years of experience with TCS and the same client, he has set his foot across various applications. Hence, the TCS team did not hesitate before assigning him to lead this initiative. His in-depth knowledge in Application, Automation and Test data preparation helped him to easily understand the client’s challenges and envisage a solution to tackle the same.

Senthilkumar set a vision of “One-click Automation” for this program. With his contextual knowledge, he decided to design and build a simple and easy-to-use framework for the end-users. During test execution, this framework had to be capable of translating test data requirement into an API call, execute SQL query in the backend to retrieve test data and inject into a Test case. In addition, he wanted to reserve and block the identified test data for future validation.

He joined hands with the TCS strategy team and explained the importance of setting a new framework for the client. With his contextual knowledge, he suggested the framework he envisioned to eliminate the problem of users requiring more technical knowledge on tables and its relationships. After many sleepless nights of interaction with the client and onsite strategy team, Senthilkumar and his team mates were able to articulate the base framework for the translation of simple test data criteria into the required API format. Test data reservation was also accomplished in this framework which was all completed before the anticipated timeline.

"Over time, there have been various evolving tools, technologies and processes in quality assurance that have benefitted enterprises, employees and end-users with an increase in productivity, cost reduction and in predicting demand for the future. However, for the client - a leading BFS company, completing an Automation test case validation without manual intervention was a serious challenge. Preparation and assignment for test data to each test scenario were considered herculean and Ajay, the IT Head of the company was responsible for incorporating automation in their testing protocols.

Preparation of Automation suite set up and test data readiness were carried out as 2 separate entities. While identifying test data, it was imperative to consider multiple variables for each test scenario which was a scrupulous effort for Ajay’s team. Joining these two pieces opened a wide range of opportunities in Quality engineering like paving the way for piloting the CICD approach. Thus, realizing the need for an expert, Ajay reached out to TCS Business Relationship Manager to find a better Automation framework with a flawless handshake of test data between backend tables and the Automation engine.	

With Senthilkumar Balasubramanian’s 13+ years of experience with TCS and the same client, he has set his foot across various applications. Hence, the TCS team did not hesitate before assigning him to lead this initiative. His in-depth knowledge in Application, Automation and Test data preparation helped him to easily understand the client’s challenges and envisage a solution to tackle the same.

Senthilkumar set a vision of “One-click Automation” for this program. With his contextual knowledge, he decided to design and build a simple and easy-to-use framework for the end-users. During test execution, this framework had to be capable of translating test data requirement into an API call, execute SQL query in the backend to retrieve test data and inject into a Test case. In addition, he wanted to reserve and block the identified test data for future validation.

He joined hands with the TCS strategy team and explained the importance of setting a new framework for the client. With his contextual knowledge, he suggested the framework he envisioned to eliminate the problem of users requiring more technical knowledge on tables and its relationships. After many sleepless nights of interaction with the client and onsite strategy team, Senthilkumar and his team mates were able to articulate the base framework for the translation of simple test data criteria into the required API format. Test data reservation was also accomplished in this framework which was all completed before the anticipated timeline.

"PBOC (People’s Bank of China) introduced a regulation, limiting each individual account to 3 types of debit account in the year 2017-18. Type 1 was the normal CASA account and Type 2/3 accounts were individual settlement accounts (10000RMB* and 1000RMB). Type 2/3 accounts could be opened remotely only after providing limited information and passing Type 1 account validation. The introduction of the regulation was to prevent money laundering and telecommunication fraud. This regulation provided other banks with the opportunity to change and establish an entirely online client base to develop business.

Amy was the Bank Manager for a US-based multinational bank operating in 17 markets in APAC and EMEA regions. Amy’s was the first American Bank to start its operations in China and wanted to launch its digital banking operations with Type 2/3 accounts. But the new regulations would result in a low margin business with only the digital channel. The cost of allocation per account of China’s mainframe core banking system was higher, making digital banking a loss-making business.

Amy’s bank had to operate on a low-cost system to justify the investment and found it difficult to accommodate the high instantaneous transaction per the second feature in the existing Chinese system. The product features to be offered and the regulatory requirements made it difficult for Amy’s bank to match the market development. The only possible solution or Amy was to use the local Chinese core banking system to deliver the digital product.

Rajappa Thirumaran (Rajappa) of TCS came with a technological and management background. He was with TCS for more than 9+ years, of which 2+ years were with Amy’s bank in Singapore. He worked with the core bank team and gained extensive knowledge of the bank’s functional domain. Rajappa’s core strengths helped validate different vendor propositions to solve the challenge of providing core digital infrastructure with low unit cost in China. Rajappa held various discussions with Amy’s business and country tech teams before zeroing in on Ping An, a prime player in China’s evolving banking ecosystem.

Ping An built a Direct banking solution that was compatible to connect with the digital ecosystem of the Chinese Open Banking system. The Direct banking solution that hosted and managed the Type 2/3 accounts, integrated with Amy’s bank for customer dedupe, fund transfer, purchase, etc. The direct banking SaaS system was hosted on a private virtual cloud as a final stage.

The Bank’s quantifiable benefit of bringing in Ping An was an estimated revenue of USD 50+ million in three years. Direct banking SaaS provided Amy’s bank with a healthy margin owing to the fact that the vendor-built solution came at a low cost per account.
China’s consumer market was the world’s most digitized and with the evolving of other markets, bigger banks would gain access to the current products and technology, living up to the expectation of the new-age customers. To stay abreast of the new era’s digital banking system, banks like Amy’s tied up with disrupting banks and the association of Ping An helped open more innovative solutions. With the success, TCS was able to develop products/cater via TCS BANCS that helped integrate new-age Fintech companies with bigger banks with a large customer base for digital transformation. The banks leveraged their existing infrastructure and the regulatory advantage helped them improve their digital footprint and time to market, compared to in-house product implementation. TCS was able to promote the product as savings of per-unit cost that arose out of the difference between the Traditional in-house offer vs. Disrupting Fintech offer.",Direct Banking Solution Was The Key To Step Into Chinas New Ecobanking System,"M, Mr. KARTHEKEYAN (Karthekeyan)",Cards,Digital Transformation,Growth & Transformation,Item,1
"Pankaj Desai had reasons to be worried and yet relieved. The management board had assigned a particular time-bound task to him. Pankaj served as the IT manager for a Cargo Liner. The cargo liner was well established in its business. The management was happy with the business growth but worried that the traditional and manual process were not able to keep pace with the growth. The staff followed a manual process to cross-verify documents (Checklists/Standing operating procedure/Specifications) in various file locations during the shipment booking process in their system as practice for the last two decades.

When the potential customers were gradually added into their business across multiple regions (NAM, APAC, EU, MEA, FEA, etc.), the number of specifications and checklists also increased customer & zone wise. When generating the shipment booking details in the system, the booking executives required too much information in terms of sticking papers surrounding them and file repositories in their system. This manual check often led to errors in the sensitive shipment booking confirmation letters.

Pankaj as IT head was worried that the task was complicated and relieved because the management agreed to his request to avail the services of TCS. Pankaj had tremendous confidence in the capabilities of TCS and immediately approached them to take up this project.

TCS entrusted the project to Sampath Kumar. Sampath had over ten years of experience working in the transportation domain. He was able to understand the business links and flows on the booking documentation process and how to minimise the manual reference works.

The client staff got used to this manual and time-consuming practice and continued it without trying any alternatives. Sampath identified this, and he brought this to the notice of Pankaj through various levels of discussions and modes. He emphasised the importance of eliminating these manual checks to improve the accuracy in sensitive shipment booking confirmation letters.
As a business analyst, he could identify the gaps in their process of essential references and linked them to the workflow tool. A double-check was done to ensure all relevant points were taken into account. He then had a round of discussions with the TCS Architects and Product Owner at client side; Sampath clearly explained the implications of the issue and possible solutions with them.

He went through the process of different levels of approvals and meetings with relevant stakeholders to implement the solution.
The scope was well defined, and the build was developed in a short time and implemented gradually across all regions. Separate master tables were created for Customer, Regional and Combination of Customer & Regional specifications, and the details were stored in DB. The shipment orders were received in the Web-based Workflow tool. Indexers made the selection of Customer & Region. All the relevant specifications were Auto-Populated from DB basis. All permutations & combinations were saved in the ‘Reference’ field for Shipment Booking executives.

When the booking executives started generating shipment booking confirmation in the system, they directly looked into the ‘Reference’ field in the workflow tool as One-Stop Point. On using this new functionality, the client got positive feedback from their booking executives. The level of accuracy in shipment documents deliveries to the customer improved. The booking process time was drastically reduced. The booking environment was paper-free. Customer complaints reduced.
Sampath received appreciation from Pankaj. The client expressed their satisfaction with TCS.",Workflow Tool Automates Shipment Order Handling Process,SHAROAN Mohammed,Automative Finance,Process optimization,Cost & Optimization,Item,1
"Parker, the technical director of a leading American automotive financing company, was worried about the business performance as his organization was facing a critical issue with their regular call operations. There was an increase of average call handle times and decline of servicing capabilities, which led to the surge of agent costs in the range of $10-12MM/year. In this situation, there was a need to equip the client’s contact centre agents with the right knowledge and skillset to deliver low-effort resolutions, quickly and effectively, thereby resulting in significant cost savings.

According to the recent review reports, Parker found out that in a span of 3 years, there was a 6% increase in average call handle time along with 15% increase in accounts outstanding per agent, implying lower servicing capabilities. Additionally, total Inbound calls increased by 10%. Parker realized the demand for a smart agent call deflection strategy in place, in order to end their long-term concern. So, he made up his mind to partner with the world-famous technological provider, TCS, to deploy the Next-gen digital solution.

A detailed discussion took place, and TCS recommended a machine-learning-based predictive solution which would help reduce the inbound calls and result in massive cost savings. For this large-scale implementation, Chandan Ghosh, who was associated with the client for 5+ years, was appointed to lead the project. Being a data scientist, Chandan understood the client scenario and analyzed that an intelligent solution combined with the appropriate Machine Learning techniques and Artificial Intelligence was the key to solve this problem. As a part of the various on-going analysis, he observed that a high volume of inbound calls with low-resolution topics were being reported over the past few quarters.

Chandan, along with his team, decided to investigate the issue further while presenting the facts and figures to the client. The team, under the leadership of Chandan, came up with some exciting findings after in-depth analysis. The TCS team proposed the concept of Intelligent Agent Call Deflection Strategies. Based on the understanding of client’s business, Chandan and the team came up with an analytical approach using predictive analytics to target customers calling in all the time. An Inbound Call Prediction Model was developed, which scored the client’s probability of making another call and estimated the volume of calls and call topic for the upcoming 30 days. By this, the agent would be able to see the 3 scores on the screen during the call.



This framework would empower both the IVR and the agent to deliver low-effort resolutions and convert customers to self-service. The Machine-Learning-based prediction helped in delivering detailed and customer-specific agent guidance at the time of Inbound Calls. It also enhanced IVR Self-Service Capabilities that enhanced the quality of customer support, while bringing down the fixed costs and reflected direct savings in the form of salaries. The total project benefits amounted to the tune of $2.5MM. Parker was very much impressed with the working approach of Chandan and applauded his dedicated efforts. The project was also showcased as a part of the Client Innovation Fair as one among the top 15 finalists. This memorable journey further strengthened the client confidence to choose TCS as the preferred partner for their future projects.",A Costeffective Solution Backed Up By Artificial Intelligence,SHAROAN Mohammed,Automative Finance,Artificial Intelligence,Cost & Optimization,Item,1
"Paul*, the CTO of a leading financial institution that deals with online banking and auto dealer finance decided to have an annual review of the IT systems. He collated data from the IT department about the systems in place and also took information from other departments about the systems they used. With all this, he began his annual review.




Halfway through the review, he noticed something alarming. He realised that every department had its own repository of customer details and they were not tapping into the master data management application that was created to be the single repository for all customer data. This fragmentation had led to redundant processes, incorrect data, and above everything, additional overhead. When Paul dug deeper into the problem, he realised that this slowdown in the usage of the master database was due to missing cross attributes and defined rules as to which lines of business owns those attributes/characteristics and has priority over others. Also for any small change in business rules, code deployment was unavoidable thereby leading to system instability and revenue loss in millions. Paul decided to clean up this mess and engaged TCS for the same.

Nibha Dash, from the account team, played a pivotal role in every phase of this implementation. Her contextual knowledge about the client’s business and IT systems and her ability to take the right decision at the right time helped to come up with a strategic plan. Her experience with the client’s IT landscape, its people, processes, system know-how, working styles, and leadership expectations enabled her to seek timely support from the experts and SMEs on the resolution of the issues. She was able to converse with the client management with equal ease and keep a check on any concerns of delivery from them.

When this project was assigned to her, Nibha knew that the end-to-end implementation of microservices with the security facet of API gateway using the Red Hat camel Fuse in the open-shift platform was the major challenge. But that didn't deter her and she began to tap into her knowledge of the client's IT systems to find a solution for it.

This implementation led to unified customer demographics with enriched demographics attributes fulfilling each business unit's needs. The de-coupling of code execution from business rules and modern technology helped in the client’s vision to modernize the system with scalability and stability as major paradigms. Advanced User Interface to input business rules, in-depth information for call centres to take smarter decisions led to greater acceptance of the master database across different business units. Other benefits included continuous CICD in terms of IT process and overall enhanced user experience of end-customers.

This project was a milestone for TCS too as this was the first end-to-end implementation of microservices involving all the segments of design, implementation, security, deployment, and CICD. This helped TCS in expanding its wing as a strategic partner in other business units of the client. In addition, this experience has helped TCS bag more business in similar implementation engagements in other BFS clients.

He realised that every department had its own repository of customer details and they were not tapping into the master data management application that was created to be the single repository for all customer data. This fragmentation had led to redundant processes, incorrect data, and above everything, additional overhead. When Paul dug deeper into the problem, he realised that this slowdown in the usage of the master database was due to missing cross attributes and defined rules as to which lines of business owns those attributes/characteristics and has priority over others. Also for any small change in business rules, code deployment was unavoidable thereby leading to system instability and revenue loss in millions. Paul decided to clean up this mess and engaged TCS for the same.

Nibha Dash, from the account team, played a pivotal role in every phase of this implementation. Her contextual knowledge about the client’s business and IT systems and her ability to take the right decision at the right time helped to come up with a strategic plan. Her experience with the client’s IT landscape, its people, processes, system know-how, working styles, and leadership expectations enabled her to seek timely support from the experts and SMEs on the resolution of the issues. She was able to converse with the client management with equal ease and keep a check on any concerns of delivery from them.

When this project was assigned to her, Nibha knew that the end-to-end implementation of microservices with the security facet of API gateway using the Red Hat camel Fuse in the open-shift platform was the major challenge. But that didn't deter her and she began to tap into her knowledge of the client's IT systems to find a solution for it.

This implementation led to unified customer demographics with enriched demographics attributes fulfilling each business unit's needs. The de-coupling of code execution from business rules and modern technology helped in the client’s vision to modernize the system with scalability and stability as major paradigms. Advanced User Interface to input business rules, in-depth information for call centres to take smarter decisions led to greater acceptance of the master database across different business units. Other benefits included continuous CICD in terms of IT process and overall enhanced user experience of end-customers.

This project was a milestone for TCS too as this was the first end-to-end implementation of microservices involving all the segments of design, implementation, security, deployment, and CICD. This helped TCS in expanding its wing as a strategic partner in other business units of the client. In addition, this experience has helped TCS bag more business in similar implementation engagements in other BFS clients. Much of this success is due to Nibha and her abilities to wade through a fine line.",Modernising Data Management Systems,Sunil John,Automative Finance,Legacy Transformation,Growth & Transformation,Item,1
"Perhaps, the launch of new schemes and facilities for the customers turn out quite challenging for organisations. In the year 2018, Ren, the CEO of a global digital banking leader in credit cards, wealth management and commercial banking, based in North America, introduced the fixed payment Capability program. This was to allow the customers to unlock the potential of their credit card by using unused credit lines to any fixed instalment loans with lower APR and payment terms as per the customers’ choices. This required setup and infrastructural changes at the DCF’s end to modify the regulatory communications. The regulatory communication to customers included a fact sheet that provided financial information (rates and fees) to the customer and cardmember agreement with the Bank.

Apparently, the challenge was to include all the terms in the existing cardmember agreement layout as required by law and to print within a number of pages that were supported by the hardware used at the transaction services and the vendor. (Card carrier Transaction services printer supported only 8-page jobs and the card member agreement was designed to fit in it). The new terms included changes in multiple sections which threatened the setup to make the hardware change as well. Hence, a solution was required to resolve the issue and so, Ren called upon TCS to undertake the assignment.

Aravindarajan P Sakkarai, a Computer programmer, as placed by TCS, worked on the issue to identify the possible solution as he had been handling all the regulatory changes in the DCF for the last 4 years and had good knowledge on the core processing and the flow. He analysed the production data, current requirements and created mockups of future changes with the current requirements within 3 days. Each section of the existing component was to be projected to the future requirements based on the size, formatting and font. Multiple variations of mockups were provided within a short period so that the business partners and legal authorities could arrive at a decision of the layout and terms going out to the customer.



Also, he analyzed the production data and identified that the number of communications sent to Spanish customers was very less compared to English. He helped the business to arrive at a decision to decommission Spanish communications for the new customers. Once the requirements were finalized, he worked on the technical changes in Exstream and mainframe to get the final version of the regulatory communications (cardmember agreement and factsheet) which was now going out to the customers.

Ren was happy with the final version of the regulatory communication created and the program extended in 2019 to all the new customers opening accounts with the client. The Director of ODT and lead of the business team sent emails appreciating TCS’s help which enabled them to arrive at the final decision so that the project was delivered on time. The functionality went live to customers in the mid of 2018 and currently, all the existing customers are being brought into this plan with multiple waves.",Modification Of The Regulatory Communications To Launch The Fixed Payment Capability Program,SHAROAN Mohammed,Cards,Regulatory & Compliance,Growth & Transformation,Item,1
"Peter, the CEO of a leading global bank, was keen to implement transformational changes in their existing business to add value to the current work. He engaged in multiple meetings with the leadership team of the bank. It was decided to create a call identifying tool. It would identify the relevant calls from the back-end call recording dump and present it to the Quality Analysts for evaluation. Hence, the tool would be able to cut the efforts of the QAs in the screening of the calls to find a ratable call, thereby increasing their productivity. The IT team of the bank was already involved in developing a tool that was both time-consuming and required a huge investment.

Therefore, Peter discussed with the QA team of TCS to develop an interim call identifying tool that would be used as a test before moving to the actual tool. The QA team of TCS was a unanimous choice as it had been supporting the bank since 2005. Soon, Sunita Rao from TCS was chosen to lead the initiative. She was designated as the Manager of the team who had taken up the opportunity to create the tool. Besides, she had contextual knowledge about the client’s various recording systems and the processes that were involved.

When Sunita became a part of the project, she, her team members, and the MIS resources started brainstorming about ways to build the tool. They came up with various permutations and combinations to create the interim tool. Additionally, Sunita joined multiple calls with the stakeholders to understand more about their requirements. Finally, the prototype was created and presented to the client in September 2019, and the testing began in October 2019. However, during the first month of the testing, the results were not as per expectations. Instead, the ratability had dropped to 87.81%, which was a major concern for the client.

After this, Sunita regrouped and gathered the October data and the back end recording system to understand the ratability issue. During the sprint planning, they reviewed the key changes that had to be made to increase the ratability of the call. It would help in saving the time of Quality Analysts. Finally, all the data synopsis were shared with the client, and also Sunita gave them various combinations from which they could choose the most suitable one. The client approved the collaborative approach. And when Sunita had all the relevant approvals in place, she enabled the testing for a few QAs. The objective was to gauge the success and to identify the necessary changes.

When all the actions were in place, the team witnessed an improvement in the testing phase, and the team ratability had shown an increasing trend since Nov 2019. The team stood at a ratability of around 97%. Moreover, there has been considerable improvement in the productivity of the resources.

"Pricing is one of the most critical factors that prospects take into consideration before turning into a buyer. What do you do when you lose clients simply because they want something more economic?




A large captive finance company in the USA was cautious of the increasing competition in their industry. Recent industry trends revealed that more buyers arrived at dealerships with pre-approved credit from direct lenders and that a growing proportion of consumers used the internet in search of the best deals, including financing incentives and warranty services. The buyer would get a quote and then fish in the market for a better price. The client thus started losing buyers to lower prices, though not necessarily better service.

The company was facing a challenge in maintaining growth through increasing consumer base. Sarah*, the Product Pricing Business Unit Head, raised the concern of maintaining constant growth and losing prospective consumers to competitors. They approached their strategic partner from 17 years, TCS, to analyse the situation and propose a favourable way out of stagnancy.

Ayan Sinha, who has been associated with the client for over a decade, was chosen to lead this project. Ayan is a Subject Matter Expert in Commercial Lending practices, which primarily include Financial Accounting, Underwriting process, financial reconciliations, Account Payable (AP) and Account Receivables (AR) processes.

Ayan had earlier played the role of a consultant in client's major transformation program, to replace legacy origination systems with a Loan Origination COTS product. Through this program, Ayan gained extensive contextual knowledge of parameters through which Loan pricing is determined for a deal. Identifying actual costs—both direct and indirect—is a necessary starting point for price development. Such costs will include the cost of capital (including regulatory capital), as well as any operating expenses related to sales and marketing, dealer types, service levels, and loan servicing. The knowledge of costs and returns was the key to the success of the program.

Based on the detailed analysis performed, Ayan created a proposal to replace the company’s traditional standard rate tool, booking codes and manual binders with a risk-based pricing model. His rich knowledge in commercial lending practice helped to create a robust solution blueprint. The pricing solution leveraged analytics, to generate alternative pricing scenarios for each tier while projecting each scenario’s impact on key performance metrics as well as broader business objectives.

This pricing excellence program helped the client to adapt to changing consumer behavior while beating the volatile economic conditions. The solution after release to market widened margins while accelerating loan origination. The solution provided compliance to accounting standards. Pricing excellence program provided client the opportunity to align pricing with organisation's success metrics (eg. Sales, Risk and Finance). The Program established pricing as a strategy-enabler for the client.

With the success of the program TCS, was offered many more large transformation initiatives from this client. There was a shift in mindset for client, who considered TCS, to be the preferred partner in technology development and digital solutions. The success of the program established a key point, for the client, that TCS, is not only the industry leader in technology and digital solutions but also in consulting landscape. ""Experience Certainty"" tag-line was well justified through the success of the program.

Post-implementation, the client’s spread widened by 5% while its return on equity improved by 12% in the first year of release. The client leadership team was impressed with this solution as it not only accelerated loan/ agreement origination but also enabled the risk organisations to make intelligent acquisition decisions.

It was inevitable to realize the potential that TCS’ Business 4.0 principles unleashed through string emphasis on analytics, automation and agility. Currently, Ayan is not only working as a consultant for this client but also assisting other accounts in TCS for key transformation initiatives in Commercial Lending domain.",Pricing Excellence Aligning Pricing With Risk,SENTHILNATHAN K.S,Retail Banking,Process optimization,Growth & Transformation,Item,1
"Project Management Group (PMO) of the client used multiple (50+) Cognos reported for their daily/weekly/monthly tracking. They were facing challenges in maintaining, updating this huge inventory. Also for most of the reports, actual owners were not in PMO anymore, so it was becoming more difficult to decipher those.

Tom* ,The Operations Manager of the client was worried about the manual work piling up for the PMO group. As these reports were published in a weekly/monthly manner and critical management decisions were being made using this data, it became of utmost importance to ensure the truthfulness of data. He was tensed about how the slow business would affect the credibility of the group. Another challenge was to update any report, how minor it was, it would take 1 week to promote a report from DEV to the UAT environment, thus paralyzing the team to do an emergency fix. Tom decided to bring in TCS for help.

Souvik was working with the client for the last 10 years in different capacities and had a thorough understanding of the PMO group’s objective, their working model, and the kind of customers they served. Having worked in the reporting and analytics domain for long, Souvik had the technical knowledge to propose an effective migration strategy.

Souvik identified these challenges with the PMO group and carried out an elaborate technical study to find a solution to those challenges. With the combination of technical expertise and domain knowledge, Souvik came up with a program called “Re-imagine PMO Reporting” to migrate things into Tableau and would automate monthly/weekly metrics creation processes.

Souvik proposed a solution that would eliminate all these different reports from Cognos. Cognos would only have 3-4 reports which would contain all the basic information and those reports would be used to reconstruct other reports in Tableau Prep. All the logics, calculations were done in Tableau prep, so the team has the entire flexibility to change anything on demand. All the metrics came out from Tableau Prep and directly replaced all manual effort. He was able to implement a new process within a shorter time frame. Through this PMO re-imagine program, the client was able to see PMO reporting from a different perspective and it positioned TCS as the choice of supplier for future reporting needs.

All the earlier pain points were being answered with the new program. The PMO team became more able to deliver correct data on time. Earlier the PMO team would require at least 10 business days to compile, validate, and publish all the metrics. After the implementation of the PMO Re-imagined process, the team was ready with all the metrics within the 2nd business day of the month. As data processing was automated through Tableau, it required one-time validation only.

Tom found it very satisfying to see how Souvik’s initiative changed a legacy process and made the new one more robust and automated. This effort was well appreciated by both the client and TCS management.

This initiative was truly in line with TCS’s focus on automation and leaned towards the digital era. Equipped with this new set up, the PMO team was engaging with more and more activities and this initiative helped things to be automated. The client’s faith in TCS’s capability increased and this would keep TCS a step ahead of its competitor.",Building The Reimagine Pmo Reporting,AMIT KUMAR SONI,Retail Banking,Reporting,Cost & Optimization,Item,2

"Property management software makes day-to-day maintenance management faster and more direct, while also enabling you, the owner or manager, to see the forest through the trees. Vasu always kept this in mind when he handled his company’s property management software. He wanted to make sure that it addressed the unique requirements of community and homeowners associations. The processes, operations, transactions, communications, accounting, administration and reporting had to be impeccable. Their customer base had reached 85, and they were getting ready to schedule a software upgrade for all.

Vasu was worried about the process. The property management software upgrade for individual consumers was executed manually. This requested for scheduled downtime. Vasu noticed that every update had differences. The upgrade for every consumer had to be performed with intense attention. There was a risk associated during the deployment. In the off-chance of a failure, it could potentially pose breach of the scheduled downtime. This would then make the application unavailable for the end-user and demand for a rollback. This would lead to a further delay with upgrades, despite the fact that the functionality for the upgrade was readily available.

Vasu connected with Suganya from TCS. She stepped in as the contextual masters to solve the case, thanks to the time that she had spent with the client on previous case narratives. This made her one of the foremost experts as she thoroughly understood the client’s landscape and infrastructure. She was able to create a customized solution that suited the client’s requirements.

Suganya deduced that automation of this upgrade would benefit the KTLO team and significantly reduce the manual effort. It would also allow the team to focus on other strategic improvements. In addition, the risk of upgrade delays could be avoided.

Automation of installation and upgrades were executed in 2 Phases. During Phase I, she automated the manual steps for upgrades and standardized the steps for upgrades to reduce the effort of manual upgrades
As part of Phase II, the plan was to provide the self-service facility for the customers and to upgrade the application with latest features with no dependency on TCS KTLO Team. This provided empowerment for the end-users to plan and execute the upgrades with no downtime and dependency/co-ordinations.

"Rajiv from TCS was leading a two-member team of sanity testers for a leading global bank’s UI gateway. Often he found that sanity testing was taking too much time, which in turn caused frustration among the client organization. The main challenge was that there were more than a hundred scenario-based flows and every day around fifteen developers delivered their changes in development or a higher environment. Thus, it was becoming cumbersome for a three-member team to carry out the sanity testing and cover as many scenarios as possible.

Moreover, due to such a situation, other vendors were trying to take advantage, and the client was also gradually losing trust in TCS capabilities. Hence, the TCS team realized that there was an urgent need to automate integration testing. This way, when a new requirement came up, the business analysts could instruct the automation tool in layman language, and it would do scenario testing as per new commands.

The TCS management promptly chipped in Suman Sadhukhan to come up with a robust solution. The onus laid on Suman to make each upcoming release easy and cost-effective. Also, the solution had to be long-term as the application had a huge expansion. However, Suman was the perfect choice for the task because he had contextual knowledge about the client’s business and technical processes. Also, he proactively gained knowledge on Selenium, the automation tool from various mediums like iEvolve, selenium documentation, and others.

"Reconciliation of payment processing settlements had been a big headache for this client due to intense manual effort in tracking and reversal transactions as well as follow up. This process was manually done until 2015 when the client finally decided to have a reconciliation system and came up with a very high-level design to resolve this issue.

The client was one of the leading providers of transaction processing and outsourcing services including application processing, business process outsourcing and IT consulting in the US. Reconciliation between the backend and frontend authorization system was the sore point for the client with transaction authorization having failed to sync up between the front and backend systems. These transactions had to be manually screened, sorted out with unbalancing report and adjusted with credit, debit transactions reversal to customer and merchant respectively for refund claims. It had become a huge challenge as neither the customer nor the merchants were aware of the real outcome of the transaction status until a few days later.

Mohanraj was working with that customer since 2010 and understood their business and environment quite deeply. He worked as an onsite coordinator and began working on reconciliation. Both frontend and backend system had been analyzed to understand all causes of out of balance and transactions mismatch situation. Transaction time from both systems were not the same and there were some differences.

Mohan’s Mainframe system knowledge and Payment processing domain knowledge and since the customer was Spanish speaking, his basic Spanish knowledge helped to build rapport quickly. Having experienced and being exposed to the client problem areas he worked on a solution approach, validated and further developed, won the confidence and approval from the client to proceed on the new design’s implementation.



Transaction logs from both the systems were extracted and reconciled separately in mainframe system since it was a batch process, mainframe could handle it promptly, generate reports and send it to merchants. Mohan’s predominant experience in Mainframe helped develop the system before the deadline. The new system was implemented and report creation processing carried out in both the system to make sure the new system was stable. The old system was disconnected in phases. The client business users could feel the differences in manual effort and out of balance situation, which drastically came down. The client felt very relaxed due to very less manual reversal of transactions.

TCS confidently entered into new LOB and gained the client confidence quickly. Although TCS didn't have a presence in the payment processing area, the client felt the strength of TCS with this successful implementation of the Payment Gateway application reconciliation system. Success was not that one instance, it was the first step to their success growth, as the first impression always make the best and it did.

"Robotic Process Automation (RPA) is the most spoken technology when it comes to automation. International banks have found it very useful to automate most of their back office processes. As every automation technique has its limitations, so does RPA, since it requires manual intervention, when a human decision is needed. Hence not all back office processes could be automated using RPA.
A major international bank and a client of TCS, have back office operations globally. Tony, the back office head wanted to automate few of their processes. The bank’s online portal facilitated its customers to submit service requests in a free form text. The back office agent had to read and understand the request to process it. Tony reached out to TCS to automate this manual operation of fulfilling request through online portal, as this would save a big chunk of cost for him.

TCS knew that this would be a complex solution, but eventually would help TCS to build their foothold in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) space. Karthekeyan, a senior architect in TCS was given this opportunity to lead this project since he was closely working with the client for 10years. From the onset, he knew that traditional programming or rule based system cannot comprehend the unique writing and vocabulary styles of each customer submitting a request. Extensive understanding of process and system involved was critical to provide an ideal solution.

The retail service operations supported around 35 different types of requests and involved updating multiple backend systems for fulfillment. Karthekeyan who knew the client’s internal process for inducting new technology and comprehensive knowledge of the involved systems came up with a proof of concept (PoC). He developed a machine learning model using neural networks with Google’s TensorFlow and Natural language processing (NLP). The model was trained using a pre-classified historic request dataset, which had to go through multiple iterations of training until a required accuracy was met. He also planned to use traditional non-GPU Linux servers and deployed the solution on-premise with excellent performance metrics.



Tony, was extremely happy to see that these models were predicting at an average accuracy of 90%. He realized that his bank would go on to save two million dollars on its opex and the benchmark would increase if more processes were automated. TCS carved a niche in the AI space by delivering this solution and the happy client went ahead prefer TCS for further automation projects involving AI and ML.

"Robotic Process Automation (RPA) is the most spoken technology when it comes to automation. International banks have found it very useful to automate most of their back office processes. As every automation technique has its limitations, so does RPA, since it requires manual intervention, when a human decision is needed. Hence not all back office processes could be automated using RPA.
A major international bank and a client of TCS, have back office operations globally. Tony, the back office head wanted to automate few of their processes. The bank’s online portal facilitated its customers to submit service requests in a free form text. The back office agent had to read and understand the request to process it. Tony reached out to TCS to automate this manual operation of fulfilling request through online portal, as this would save a big chunk of cost for him.

TCS knew that this would be a complex solution, but eventually would help TCS to build their foothold in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) space. Karthekeyan, a senior architect in TCS was given this opportunity to lead this project since he was closely working with the client for 10years. From the onset, he knew that traditional programming or rule based system cannot comprehend the unique writing and vocabulary styles of each customer submitting a request. Extensive understanding of process and system involved was critical to provide an ideal solution.

The retail service operations supported around 35 different types of requests and involved updating multiple backend systems for fulfillment. Karthekeyan who knew the client’s internal process for inducting new technology and comprehensive knowledge of the involved systems came up with a proof of concept (PoC). He developed a machine learning model using neural networks with Google’s TensorFlow and Natural language processing (NLP). The model was trained using a pre-classified historic request dataset, which had to go through multiple iterations of training until a required accuracy was met. He also planned to use traditional non-GPU Linux servers and deployed the solution on-premise with excellent performance metrics.

"Roger was the Head HR of a leading global bank. In recent times, he was getting too many requests for resource allocation from various projects, namely mandatory, legal, compliance, and Run the Bank projects. The demand was high for testers. But Roger struggled hard to allocate resources due to inadequate resource capacity. The result was insufficient testers in each project. Roger took up the issue with the senior management and asked for increasing the resource capacity. But the organization did not have the budget to increase resource capacity. Hence, the only solution was to implement an innovative solution to this problem.

The bank got in touch with TCS, and Parveen from TCS was chosen as the Retail Project Manager for the testing team. Parveen had previously worked with the same client manager in various other domains and had got the opportunity to explore different market tools. Therefore, she had extensive contextual knowledge of implementing tools in Mortgage and CARDS. Also, she had previously managed the resource capacity and so could easily gauge the pain area of the client.


As the project kickstarted, the TCS team, under the leadership of Parveen, started looking for an alternative solution to improve resource efficiency by using tools. During the process, they found that testers were writing too many simple manual scripts that could be optimized to save resource time. At the same time, there was no automated tool in place to effectively use existing resource capacity and to enhance their productivity.

Taking into account the current problem, Parveen and her team proposed and implemented ARD (Agile requirements designer). Leveraging her contextual knowledge of implementation experience, Parveen could finish the ARD POC for the Retail testing area in a shorter timeframe.

Once the tool was implemented, the client was immensely happy as they could have optimized scripts written automatically through the ARD tool. Also, it saved several resource hours in the Retail testing area, and the client could take in more projects with the existing capacity. Currently, the tool is also solving the problem of script optimization in the EFD (Enterprise fraud detection) application.


Parveen was highly appreciated for her efforts, and TCS gained the client’s confidence and reliability to implement the best industry practices and tools.",Agile Requirements Designer Tool Enhances Productivity With Existing Resources,AMIT KUMAR SONI,Retail Banking,OpEx,Cost & Optimization,Item,1
"Ron* was the head of Operations of a leading bank and he broke the bad news to Vish*, the TCS account manager. TCS had lost the testing RFP to a new vendor, still, Ron didn't want to replace all the TCS resources because of the long-standing relations between the two companies that spanned across 15 years. Instead, they retained few resources in each team and replaced the rest with the resources of the new vendor.

During this transition phase, Ron wanted help from TCS in managing multiple vendors seamlessly. He was, in particular, worried about the developmental delays and the inability to meet delivery timelines due to the lack of collaboration between the different teams. This request came to TCS as Ron understood the in-depth knowledge and the deep relations that TCS shared with his company. Vish also agreed despite knowing that there was nothing for the company to gain except the client's trust. Yet as a goodwill gesture, TCS accepted Ron's request and assigned Sandeep to the task of transitioning and collaborating all the resources.

Sandeep had been with this client for many years and understood the client's working model and expectations. Based on his experience and rapport with the clients, he got to know the new team members and organized weekly meetings with other vendors to onboard them to the project. He was available to solve all their queries and this came in handy when the members of the new vendor team were facing issues. Besides working on the areas that were assigned to TCS, Sandeep also worked with other teams and ensured that there were no delays whatsoever in all the team's projects. He also worked hard to provide a defect-free delivery to the client - all with the intent to rebuild the client's trust in TCS.






These selfless efforts paid off for TCS as the trust built between TCS and the client strengthened further. The client understood Sandeep's efforts and appreciated the entire TCS team for the spirit they showed even when they were not chosen for a project. From TCS's standpoint, this still led to a win-win situation as it was chosen as the preferred IT partner for the client, thanks to the resource managers who had a hand in deciding to whom a project can be allocated. Many projects were allocated to TCS because of the rapport that people like Sandeep had with the client and the personal favors that they have done like this one.

All the Agile teams were allocated to TCS and the headcount increased to 20 from the 16 that existed even before the RFP. This was a true victory for not just Sandeep, but the entire TCS team. And it once again reiterated the fact that building the client's trust is the single biggest priority even if it entails some sacrifices along the way! And Sandeep led the way by leveraging on his technical and contextual knowledge of the client's systems and operations.",Streamlining Transition And Collaboration With Multiple Vendors,N.

"Ryan had missed a beat. Technology hadn’t. And now, as the CTO of a leading mortgage loan origination product, Ryan knew his misstep could cost the company dearly, in revenue and repute, as it struggled to scale up and enhance user experience. The fallouts were already visible in missed delivery timelines, unresolved late UAT issues, release rollbacks, affected SLAs, and penalties.

All this, because the company’s Loan Origination System (LOS) product that was built in 2004 was never upgraded. This time round, however, Ryan didn’t miss a beat. He requested TCS to take over the maintenance and enhancement of legacy system.
Sachin Hegde, who was asked by the consultancy to lead the project, quickly formed a team to identify the problem areas and find suitable solutions for each one of them. He identified issues like the growing backlogs on production, late UAT defects, and defects in production leading to availability issues for the LOS platform, etc.

With his Agile and DevOps experience, Sachin identified the different moving parts that would need to be addressed to find a resolution for application stability through DevOps transformation, product requirement stability, book keeping sanity, and process improvements in Agile delivery. Next, he worked on process improvements that included new gatekeeping measures, new engagement measures for quality issues, automation through DevOps, and even training the team and customers toward Agile working style.

He also conducted multiple brainstorming sessions to understand the core issues and underlying concerns from the team. He leveraged anonymous feedback tools to understand the day-to-day operational needs so that he could find effective solutions. Sachin had to address a lot of concerns -- lack of version and access controls, ambiguous business requirements, lack of stability, code deployment issues, etc.

He started to address the issues one by one and by working on operational changes with DevOps in parallel. He implemented changes like strict gatekeeping measures to stop any new alteration in product apart from scoped items, conducted QA test case review sessions twice a week with client UAT teams to reduce late UAT bugs, formed a single dashboard monitoring for all ticket status, automated environment checks to help developers/testers by raising early alerts, arranged for weekly calls between developers and architecture team for faster resolution, etc.

With the successful implementation, the TCS team and the client management noticed a high application availability (nearly 100 percent for the last 2 years), there were no SLA misses, or schedule/cost slippages. The load on customer helpdesk was reduced by 50 percent, and service restoration through KT documentation on confluence was much quicker.

All this could be achieved only because of Sachin’s agile-based automation implementation, his quick thinking, the hard work of the architecture and technical teams, and the continued support of the TCS team – all of which were thoroughly appreciated by Ryan and the company’s senior management.",Agilebased Automation Solution For Application Upgrade,Sunil John,Mortgages,Agile Transformation,Cost & Optimization,Item,1
"Sam spent hours looking at the increasing number of user-related tickets that were being thrown up. It brought to light the lack of user understanding and training. There was another severe issue at hand. The support team was involved in manual activities due to the lack of sufficient system functionalities. These applications were not equipped for the required monitoring resulting in outages. Various development teams working on the common platform resulted in conflicts and issues in the common infrastructure. This also impacted TCS’s team to manage its resources effectively to address the primary support areas. This resulted in a high number of tickets impacting the SLA met percentage of tickets making TCS eligible for the financial penalty.

TCS was the client’s IT Strategic partner. Chandan Mondal was roped in to create a solution. He had been associated with the client since 2013. He had in-depth client business, technology, and infrastructure landscape knowledge, which has been achieved over the period, eventually helping in identifying and proposing the solution. Chandan had been working for over seven years in this engagement and frequently interacted with business and various technology teams. He had played various roles like Module lead, Team lead, Transition lead as required by TCS over the span of time spent. He was aware of the pain areas that needed to be addressed.

Chandan designed a concept to build a robust and seamless application support model spanning multiple continents and time zones for the client. He had primarily been associated with application support for their Risk Operational Risk under Global Functions Technology Services (GFTS) – RISK. Since the beginning, he had been working towards the GPA goal of reducing tickets coming to the support team from various sources (Users, Development, Partner systems, etc.).

Chandan and his team had been an integral part of the TCS team in proposing and implementing various solutions to address the client’s issues. They raised training issues in the relevant platforms and prepared documents to help the users. The team emphasized the need to automate manual activities that helped reduce manual effort. They looked into the available options (Appdynamics, RTView, etc.) of alert mechanisms and ensured that alerts were set up for respective applications. Chandan then streamlined the infrastructure management process by taking control.
Chandan applied his interpersonal skills to deal with his team members and the clients along with multiple technical skills to work in the continuously changing environments. TCS training materials and the vast presence of TCS across multiple application support under GPA helped to gain specific knowledge whenever required though colleagues working here.

The solutions implemented helped the client achieve their desired GPA and their goal of reduced tickets over the years. Alerts were streamlined, and infrastructure had become stable. The client realized great savings on yearly spending on support activities and also the applications under GPA. They were also satisfied with improvements made in infrastructure management and User issues handling. Applications were being able to achieve their financial, regulator delivery goals timely. These improvements helped reduce the chances of TCS being penalized for a breach of SLA of tickets.",Deploying Advanced Technology To Reduce Tickets,"M, Mr. KARTHEKEYAN (Karthekeyan)",Cards,Production Management,Cost & Optimization,Item,2
"Sam was the CEO of a large Financial Institution in the US and around the world. It had over 200 million customer accounts in around 140 countries. In spite of the stronghold in the market, the company was facing performance issues in most of its critical applications. Sam was worried because it was causing downtime and affecting the production. So, he decided to dig deeper and understand the root cause of the problem.

Sam realised that most of the issues occurred due to a lack of performance engineering process. Also, the performance KPI was not defined, which made it difficult to focus on nonfunctional requirements. Due to the performance issues, the company’s maintenance cost and downtime were increasing, thus impacting the end user’s business. So, Sam decided to address the problem through detailed documentation and repeatable process setup.

This project would address and understand the maturity of the current performance testing processes. Based on this information, it would determine the performance management principles along with the development and maintenance results in better application performance at all times. Since the task was critical, Sam decided to approach TCS, which was their existing partner in multiple projects.

Saravanan Selvam from TCS was roped in as a contextual master to drive the project. The reason was apparent. He had worked with the client for the past few years and had gained in-depth knowledge of the client’s business, application architecture, business transactions, and key volumes. With the help of this acquired contextual knowledge, Saravanan was able to find a feasible solution.


After detailed analysis, Saravanan suggested the TCS framework of the shift-left approach to start the performance engineering activities in the early stage of the development phase. He also proposed recommendations to improve the application performance testing process by creating the nonfunctional requirements, workload modeling, test strategy, and defining the performance KPI. Saravanan gathered the information and recommended the right tool and plan to be deployed for the monitoring process. Further, he tested the applications for all business-critical steps under production like situations.

The presence of a dedicated performance environment, monitoring, and analysis of performance before production signoff, early performance testing, code profilers, intelligent automation of processes helped reduce the downtime and increase application stability. Saravanan also identified the critical applications which were having frequent releases and considerable impacts on the business. He collected the NFR at the early stages of the development life cycle and defined the test strategy, workload analysis for critical business transactions. Based on this information, Saravanan baselined the performance benchmark and executed the load and soak test to identify any performance bottlenecks in the applications.

The client was happy with Saravanan’s solution because the team was able to identify lots of performance issues and recommend system tuning. This helped to reduce the downtime and improve the business. After certifying each release, Saravanan and his team got appreciation from the client. This strengthened the TCS-client relationship, which led to future engagements.",Enhance The Performance Of Critical Applications,SHAROAN Mohammed,Cards,Process optimization,Cost & Optimization,Item,2
"Sam was the IT head of a leading financial service company in the US. Of late, he was under too much work pressure as the organisation had implemented the concept of Global Common Code (GC) and clustered ten APAC countries as part of this critical initiative.

During the implementation, Sam faced many challenges. This is because the project was delivered across the monthly and quarterly releases based on agile mode with no efficient approach of highlighting the risk of completion. As an agile-based project, the different user stories were scoped in on an ad-hoc basis to the testing team. The delayed requirements overlapping subsequent phases impacted the quality and schedule of the deliverable. Due to the absence of proper capacity planning and risk assessment method, different completion risks were not highlighted, thereby impacting the project delivery on time.

Sam knew that the company required a dynamic approach to highlight the risk based on current capacity, the number of test cases pending to execute and the complexity of the application. Also, it needed to present the completion date of the different projects in the planned way. This would help to restructure team allocation and planning, thereby mitigating the risks and providing the delivery on time. TCS was their strategic partner since 2005, managing various critical projects. Hence, Sam approached TCS to help him with the problem.

Upon understanding the task, Dinesh Agarwal was roped in as a contextual master to drive the project. This is because he had previously worked with the client and had gained in-depth knowledge of their functionality of applications, architecture, level of testing, risks and the test cases prioritised on the different parameters. Besides, he had a good understanding of both programming and testing areas. With the help of this acquired contextual knowledge, Dinesh was able to implement a quick fix to the problem.






At the start, Dinesh carried out multiple discussions with different stakeholders and understood how the process was done manually. Based on this information, he proposed an idea of automating the different flow that helped to assess the risk in a project. With the help of the acquired contextual knowledge, Dinesh transformed his idea in the macro-based MS Excel utility. He suggested implementing the project risk analyser that would calculate the risk based on the different input parameters. This included an average pass rate of historical data across different modules, current release scope, outstanding test cases as per the current date and the user input prioritising and customising the sorting order. Within seconds, the analyser would highlight the project and the module that were at risk. In parallel, it will also determine the completion date of different projects and user stories.

Post-implementation, the client was happy with the solution because it improved the overall capacity planning and risk assessment. The client appreciated Dinesh's efforts which paved the way for many new opportunities for TCS.",Successful Automation To Assess Project Risk,Dinesh Jindal,Enterprise Applications,Automation,Cost & Optimization,Item,1
"Sam*, the client manager had just returned from a director level meeting at one of the world’s top banks. The agenda of the meeting was an external audit where the organization had received multiple findings and the management was asked to come up with the response and provide supporting data for the response. Sam was asked to handle this mammoth task along with a small team that was responsible for compliance.

This team was just a support group with a limited workforce and technical knowledge and it was already tied up with multiple user queries and regular deliveries. The team was performing Process Quality Assurance for all the projects and programs and was involved in the maintenance work for the entire organization. Apart from that, the team was catering to all the technological needs of the CBORC group to generate their reports. Given this work load, Sam felt that he had to look at other options. After a few brainstorming sessions, he came up with a self-service tool that can allow other groups to prepare and extract their reports, thereby opening some time for this team.

As a first step, the team had to collate the data coming from different sources, clean the same, and generate reports based on it. Apart from that, each department had its unique requirements and this became difficult for the team to cater to. So, Sam reached out to TCS to create a self-reporting tool and Amit was assigned to it.

Amit had been with the group for more than 6 years. He had played a pivotal role in architecture design and development of the entire homegrown PQA tool as well as the entire reporting process. With strong contextual knowledge, and understanding of the client processes, knowledge of various data feeds, and an understanding of various reporting tools, he was a trusted partner of the client.

Amit had a complete knowledge of data feeds and strong database skills due to his Oracle DBA background and these helped him in a big way. He researched various options available in the market based on the client's needs and the need to have a rich visualization that would ease the decision-making process. Using his rapport with the client, he sourced the Tableau license, created a POC, and presented it to Sam and other directors.

Impressed with his POC, one of the directors supported the additional funding needed to get Tableau licenses for the entire team. Next, Amit arranged various training sessions for the entire team and helped them to come to speed for the rollout of Tableau. Within the short duration of 2 months, the team was able to migrate all of the reports to Tableau.

With end users now able to self-serve their data and reporting needs, the team could focus on more strategic analytics activities that offered far greater value to the organization. The creation of a single source of truth also improved data consistency and cut the internal disagreements by ensuring everyone was looking at the same data sets all the time, rather than Excel duplicates or locally created extracts.

It also had a positive impact on staff retention and made the team more attractive to new employees because they could see the work that was being done and its importance to the overall business strategy.

"Samantha Adams*, Head of Operations of one of the financial services giants in the US tried to take her mind off work and enjoy her coffee break but her mind kept wandering. “We have been constantly producing microservices at a very high rate, however our quality and standards have suffered a lot due to disparate governance processes and limited resources in each region”, she reminded herself.

Even though Samantha knew that integration of governance policies is a must, it remained a distant dream for over 5 years now. “With the maturity of microservices pool, the next phase of consolidation of technical assets is required to kick-start reuse and monetise the effort”, she continued with her trail of thoughts. Despite multiple communications and organisational hierarchical re-alignments, development processes of APAC, Mexico and North America could not be standardised. Appalled, she fathomed, “Rollout of common policy was barely less than 10%. If we consolidate the middleware offerings at policy level, we can surly get advance solutions at global scale.” Additionally, the cultural nuances between the regions and lack of a common platform had been the most difficult to break through.

The customer is a consumer division of a financial services multinational, with over 723 branches in US and over 1400 branches in Mexico. They offer a wide selection of investments such as individual stocks, fixed income, mutual funds, as well as more sophisticated offerings, including alternative investments and structured products. TCS has been their IT solutions partner for more than a decade. In a desperate attempt to improve their operational efficiency, Samantha decided to collaborate with TCS to come up with an action plan.

Abhilasha Watal took up the reins of this project as Process Analyst. She has worked with the customer for over 12 years in various capacities, such as service designer, service implementation lead, TCS delivery manager and governance board member. Her proven communication skills, understanding of work cultures, relationship with team owners, and exposure to various businesses of the customer were added advantages. She worked to reverse-engineer the steps followed by regional governance teams by holding numerous sessions, across locations.

Abhilasha delivered draft processes in less than three months, as a result, the extremely delighted customer commissioned her for further process integration. A portal was rolled out through carefully planned multiple soft launches, various brown bag sessions, pilot launches and live sessions. This minimised resistance to processes’ acceptance.

Samantha appreciated the new portal and it was accepted as the new normal, as it eliminated the biggest hurdle of location specific governance. Once launched and stabilised, the solution evolved rapidly resulting in common Scrum and global metrics reporting across locations. Due to this implementation, the runtime governance was being initiated, globally.
Customer generously appreciated the delivery at all levels, multiple times, through appreciation e-mails and communication to delivery partners. Customer’s confidence in TCS increased manifold.

"Satish was an IT consultant from TCS. He was managing the Customer Complaint Tracking Tool for a leading bank in the USA. The tool was used to provide uniform capture and storage of customer complaint, dispute, inquiry, and compliment contact events via a reusable, integrated capture portal component. It had case management abilities that multiple, pre-approved host applications could subscribe to for a uniform capture throughout the organisation. This application was critical for the client as it was used by 20 host applications and served around 33000 internal agents.

Being a hardworking and dedicated person, Satish used to always complete his tasks much before the deadline. But, of late, he was under too much work pressure. This is because the client was facing a latency issue while loading the application in the Host Systems. As a result, it impacted most of the customer-facing applications across the branch locations. Due to this latency issue, the branch users were unable to launch the application with slow internet speed connection.

So, to resolve the problem, the client raised several incident tickets. But, Satish was unable to find a solution. It affected the productivity of the bank and its reputation. So, Satish decided to rope in Subramanian as a contextual master to help him with the problem. This is because he had been working as a Technical Lead with the client for a long time. As a result, Subramanian was aware of the processes and the details of the Customer-facing applications. Besides, he had a vast knowledge about the infrastructure and different teams within the bank. With the help of this acquired contextual knowledge, Subramanian was able to find a quick fix to the problem.

At the start, Subramanian identified the issues within the application and recommended the appropriate solution. He understood that there was taxonomy data loading in the application based on the line of business and functional group for each user. This functionality made more database or service calls to pull the taxonomy data every time. Every time the user requested the application, it loaded dropdown values with these taxonomy data. To avoid too many requests to the database, Subramanian recommended implementing the caching technique in the application server context level. This was because the application was running with 16 Java Virtual machines and so implementing at contact level would be the best place to work correctly. Finally, all the taxonomy data got cached in server memory and loaded into application every time the user requested the page. Also, Subramanian implemented corn job scheduler in Java code and made the call to the database to update the new taxonomy data in the server cache.

Post-implementation, the client was happy with the solution because it worked perfectly across the bank. Also, it had a significant impact on application performance and agent's productivity. The client appreciated Subramanian's efforts, which paved the way for many new opportunities for TCS.",Caching Technique Implementation On The Complaint Capture Tool,N.

"Seeing is believing, and the Jason, CIO of a global financial services organization was only beginning to realize how true that statement was. One of the online applications of the corporation allowed retail banking customers high volume amount transfers to other bank accounts. There were several fraud detection features that ran in the background, but since it did not require any kind of OTP or Challenge Question validation before processing the transaction, it triggered fear and skepticism in the hearts of users. As they refused to use the application, so too did the impact to business begin to show.

Looking for a solution, Jason turned to TCS, a new vendor partner for this application. The consultancy was already doing PoCs to improve aspects of the application, including testing automation using Selenium, using Microservice to improve performance, etc., and suggested Microservice to be incorporated in the application. It assigned Subhendu Dutta to lead the charge. Even in the short time he had been with the client, Subhendu had acquired knowledge of what the application was for and the business logic behind most of the features it offered. Additionally, Subhendu had expertise in Microservice and knew that Microservice-based Authentication systems were present in the Retail Banking application, on which he had worked. So, he understood that multi-layer authentication was missing only in a part of the embedded functionalities of Business Online application. His knowledge about the authentication process in the Retail Application also helped him incorporate the same for the embedded feature. He worked alone through development, and coordinated with various teams across channels for the validations required. Scheduled working sessions with multiple teams also helped identify problems and provide quick solutions.

A serious challenge was to move the authentication process to production successfully after several rounds of rigorous testing in UAT environment. Being a very sensitive feature, any issue with this new authentication system could stop the functionality altogether, affecting customers in no time. But finally, it was moved to production with no major issue and client was really happy to repeatedly appreciate all the help and support the TCS team provided.

This was a win-win situation for both TCS and client as TCS, being a new vendor, earned the much-needed confidence of the client, and client too was able to provide a much-expected authentication system to its users.
The success of this project changed the client’s perception about TCS significantly. They were very happy about the solution provided and also about the way the Subhendu worked in collaboration with many other teams from different vendors. The promptness and expertise showcased in resolving every single defect pre and post production was highly appreciated.

"Shaun was the customer of a leading global bank, but lately, he was not happy with the services of the bank. He could not decipher the email alerts of branded cards sent by the bank as they were not ADA compliant. However, Shaun was not the only one; there were complaints from many other visually challenged customers.

Mark, the chief operating officer of the bank, was worried about the entire situation. If the condition prevailed, it was likely that the bank would lose many blind customers. Hence, it was a pressing need to make all the alerts ADA compliant. At this juncture, Mark got in touch with TCS for assistance. The primary requirement was to make alerts sent by the bank ADA compliant.

Shunmugha Pathy Subramanian Thangathurai from TCS was chosen to lead the initiative. He was the perfect choice for the task as he had contextual knowledge about the client’s existing system. At the same time, he was aware that the implementation should happen in such a way that it did not affect the existing system.



Soon Shunmugha took up the responsibility to find a similar system called the DCF that was owned by the client. The DCF also sent email alerts to many customers of the bank, which were ADA compliant. The DCF used the Cheetah tool to send email alerts to all customers, including visually impaired customers. Thus, Shunmugha and his team planned to send a feed file from the bank’s alerts to the DCF system. As a next step, email alerts were sent using the DCF instead of the bank’s usual alert system.

The TCS team also realized that most of the alerts were present at the bank’s usual alert system, including both batch and real-time alerts, and it was impossible to send the request to DCF. Thus, he came up with a solution to get the requests from all the systems. Then Shunmugha captured the data from those requests in a new extract file and sent them to the DCF using the NDM. It would help them send alerts from their DCF system, which would be ADA compliant, thereby benefitting the blind customers of the bank.
The client was elated with the solution as all the email alerts of the bank had become ADA compliant, which in turn helped them maintain a competitive edge in the market.

"Shaun was the customer of a leading global bank, but lately, he was not happy with the services of the bank. He could not decipher the email alerts of branded cards sent by the bank as they were not ADA compliant. However, Shaun was not the only one; there were complaints from many other visually challenged customers.

Mark, the chief operating officer of the bank, was worried about the entire situation. If the condition prevailed, it was likely that the bank would lose many blind customers. Hence, it was a pressing need to make all the alerts ADA compliant. At this juncture, Mark got in touch with TCS for assistance. The primary requirement was to make alerts sent by the bank ADA compliant.

Shunmugha Pathy Subramanian Thangathurai from TCS was chosen to lead the initiative. He was the perfect choice for the task as he had contextual knowledge about the client’s existing system. At the same time, he was aware that the implementation should happen in such a way that it did not affect the existing system.



Soon Shunmugha took up the responsibility to find a similar system called the DCF that was owned by the client. The DCF also sent email alerts to many customers of the bank, which were ADA compliant. The DCF used the Cheetah tool to send email alerts to all customers, including visually impaired customers. Thus, Shunmugha and his team planned to send a feed file from the bank’s alerts to the DCF system. As a next step, email alerts were sent using the DCF instead of the bank’s usual alert system.

"Simon is the IT head of a leading auto finance company in the United States. The IT department had to provide a standardized address to the rest of the enterprise for various uses like billing, marketing, reporting, privacy etc. Simon was facing challenges in providing the standardized address as the data has to go through a quarterly address Re-Cleanse process before distribution. The Master Data Management (MDM) application has to execute the Re-Cleanse process which was taking around 90 days to complete for every quarter. By the time the previous quarter address Re-Cleanse got completed, the next Re-Cleanse process would start for the next quarter without providing any scope for process improvements in the system.

The client’s Master Data Management (MDM) application performing the quarterly address Re-Cleanse process in 90 days was impacting the business and its stakeholders. Firstly, it was causing incorrect data being distributed to the enterprise. It required continuous effort from the Data team to manually correct the addresses. Thirdly, it resulted in wrong privacy and credit reporting and finally it led to compliance issues and bad customer experience. Simon wanted to implement a solution that could reduce the quarterly process time so that accurate data can flow to downstream and upstream systems.

TCS has been the service provider for MDM application and the client approached TCS to provide a viable solution to resolve the issue. TCS appointed Dipak K Das as the Contextual Master (CM) for this program. Dipak has been working as a technical lead, architect with the client’s MDM application for several years and has thorough knowledge on the functional and technical knowledge on the MDM application.

Dipak had in-depth contextual knowledge on MDM application’s integration with the upstream as well as the downstream systems, rule engine tools and the quality of data captured in the database. Dipak performed comparative analysis of various processes in the existing system for a better understanding of the bottlenecks that were causing huge delay in the process. The data quality tool was used in the existing process for cleansing data. Dipak found that instead of using the cleansed data that was created by the tool, the Re-Cleanse process was selecting the user record IDs from the database and using these IDs in another process to cleanse the data in real time using business layer processing. The business layer as in any system comprised of complex business rules and hence business layer processing will be CPU intensive and delays the process.

Dipak understood that using Database layer processing instead of Business layer processing would speed up the process. Dipak proposed to simplify the existing solution to leverage the cleansed data provided by the data quality tool. The proposed solution would bypass the business layer processing and work on the database layer for faster processing and improving the efficiency. The client was excited and agreed to implement the solution. This simple change helped the MDM address Re-Cleanse process to get completed in 5 days allowing enough time for the next process.

The implementation of Dipak’s solution was a great success. The simple process change suggested by Dipak helped the MDM processing time from 90 days to 5 days. The client is thrilled with the reduction in the process time and are executing the Re-Cleanse process every month and have plans for executing it every week. The solution has resulted in 94% process improvement and has significantly reduced the manual effort involved in address correction.

Dipak has proved that the solution need not always have to be big and complex and even simple and small ‘Kaizen’ can have a greater and positive impact on the system/processes. The client top management and IT team could not praise Dipak more and had always looked up to him for suggestions on any process improvements. Dipak had been playing a pivotal role in strengthening the relationship between client and TCS.",Kaizen Approach That Adds Value,Mohit Goyal,Automative Finance,Regulatory & Compliance,Cost & Optimization,Item,1
"Sisolak in the capacity of a CTO was heading a leading global bank that takes pride in being the first financial services company in the U.S. to bring together banking, insurance, and investments under one umbrella. The bank has ~300,000 employees managing 200mn customer accounts across six continents in more than 160 countries. Sisolak had always emphasized the need for ways of improving productivity, which was important for every organization in a competitive environment.

When Sisolak reached out to TCS, Gaurav Duggal from TCS came forward to take up the responsibility of streamlining and finding a solution. Among the many of the bank’s IT services that TCS supports, Quality Assurance was a crucial one. Gaurav and his team dived deep and through their analysis, they observed that the majority of the defects were related to Log and Email Standards for Batch Scripts in the test environment. There were also repeated occurrences of similar defects in different projects in different releases. So Gaurav decided to find a solution to reduce the occurrences of these defects.

Gaurav Duggal was aware of the processes and systems involved and had the contextual knowledge on shell scripts, servers, and Quality Assurance processes which were critical in providing a solution. He was also experienced in the financial domain.
Having gained experience by donning the roles of Analyst, Test Coordinator, Team Lead and having had led many projects for the bank, Gaurav’s knowledge of the bank’s IT environment helped in devising strategies to improve the operations and business, to reduce occurrences of defects related to Log and Email Standards. Gaurav and his team worked on the scope and with the detailed analysis of each defect raised in a year, it was found that, out of the total defects raised in a year, 46% of the defects were related to Log and Email Standards and warranted reduction to save cost and time.

Gaurav defines the Log and Email standards for Batch scripts and using his contextual knowledge on shell scripts, UNIX, NDM, databases, business processes and he came up with a document where 25+ items related to Log and Email Standards were listed that required to be agreed by Sisolak before they could be finally defined and documented. Gaurav involved all the stakeholders from the development and testing groups and explained all 25+ items to the group. Gaurav was successful in receiving acceptance and agreement for all the 25+ items to be defined as the basic Log and Email Standards for developing Database Batch Scripts.
Sisolak and the stakeholders noticed the benefits of defining the standards and were impressed by the out-of-the-box idea and appreciated Gaurav. After the standards were implemented there was a drastic reduction of defects in the Log and Email standards which proved to be cost-effective and time-efficient and also increased the operational efficiencies",Defects Reduced By Defining Log And Email Standards,SENTHIL Shiyalam,Data Analytics ,Process optimization,Cost & Optimization,Item,1
"Sometimes you can do everything right and yet not everything falls in place. This is what Jackson, the CIO of a bank felt when he looked at his track record. It was late 2015. Three years had passed since he took over as the CIO and head of technology for APAC and EMEA consumer operations for a large global bank. He played some pretty brave moves at work to reduce expenses. He aligned his bank toward strategic partners like TCS, turned around the release quality, streamlined the demand-fitment, and increased the technology team’s productivity by over 15%. This resulted in delivering over 65,000 person-days to build effort every quarter.

The problem was that all was still not well. His scorecard was red when it came to End of Life (EOL) and End of Support (EOS) compliance, and he just got one year to remediate. The bank’s APAC and EMEA consumer business was serving 17 countries and was offering services under three major product portfolios - retail banking, cards, and private banking. It was budgeting close to $9MM a year to upgrade EOL/EOS applications to the latest tech stack or latest software versions. But due to the complexity of the upgrades, late prioritization, and few other factors, several EOL/EOS projects spilled over releases. Eventually, they missed the deadline, thus resulting in Jackson’s dashboard turning red.

The issue was simple and logical. When an application or a third party software did not get upgraded before its EOL (End of Life) or EOS (End of Support) date, the bank was at the risk of running its systems with outdated technology or software. It caused the potential failure with no support from the software providers. This could also disrupt its day-to-day operations and threaten its functioning, thus leading to huge loss of money, credibility, and in worst cases, its license to operate in a region.
Jackson wanted to get out of this situation by finding a way to remediate the pending EOL/EOS software within the next 12 months. TCS saw an opportunity to chip in and help the client with the situation.






Yuvraj’s working experience with the client since 2005, along with his expertise in the subject matter, helped him gain in-depth contextual knowledge in the client’s business functions and how they worked as a team. Yuvraj led the discussions with the client’s manager to understand their issues in executing EOL/EOS projects.

Yuvraj found that the EOL/EOS projects were complex infrastructure upgrade projects that required extensive collaboration between the application teams and infrastructure teams. They needed fixing the glitches on the go, uncovering issues that were never-before encountered. In some cases, re-writing of the application ground up with no source code. He also found that these projects were one among many projects that got fitted into a release with no special focus, and there wasn’t a single accountable owner from the client-side.

A separate SOW was carved out for this engagement with a finite number of EOL/EOS projects to be executed, and owners were assigned on both TCS and the client-side.

During the first year of the engagement, TCS successfully delivered the projects in scope, remediating 294 EOL/EOS components, helping the CIO’s scorecard turn green.

"Sophie, the senior manager of a prominent bank, was pondering over the discussion she had the previous day with the business head. She had put forth a proposal to leverage their card carrier generation process. On a regular basis, the bank was associated with an external vendor for handling the printing and mailing of the credit cards.

Sophie knew that the company sent two separate files to the vendor - one for printing cards and the other for printing card carriers (letter on which card was affixed). This card carrier generation process was a complicated one where the bank’s data was sent to the vendor, and the vendor sent the same data back to the bank again to create card carrier PDFs. In cases, when the bank needed additional data to be printed on the card carrier, they involved the vendor’s development team in getting their files modified.

Sophie felt that overall the vendor’s process exhibited very slow turnover of work at a high billing rate. Hence, she had a valuable discussion with the business head, and they decided to consult with the TCS team for optimizing the card carrier process. TCS was already a strategic partner to the client, involved in the development, maintenance and production support activities. Sophie and the TCS team jointly realized that the dependency with the external vendor had slowed down the progress of their significant projects.



So, the TCS team suggested removing the dependency with the vendor; by which the bank could deploy the projects quicker and even avoid additional expenditure, due to the involvement of the vendor in the card carrier PDF generation process. TCS took a smart move of bringing in Shunmugasubramanian Ganapathirajan (CM) for handling the bank’s requirements. CM had been working with the bank since 2010. He had strong knowledge and in-depth understanding of the card embossing process, which helped him to come up with a workaround for this specific problem. As an onshore lead, CM closely worked on the development of all the projects involved with the team.

As the vendor dependency was a long-continued problem, CM proposed two different solutions for resolving the issue and presented it to Sophie and the client team. Out of which, one of the solutions was accepted by them. CM suggested to stop sending the card carrier specific data to the vendor; instead, a unique number would be sent to the vendor along with card data. With this, the vendor would just send this unique number back to the bank, instead of the whole card carrier data. CM developed an internal SQL table to house the card carrier data along with the unique number. It would generate PDFs for all the unique numbers sent by the vendor by fetching the data from the SQL table.

This unique solution was accepted by the bank and was planned to be deployed along with another migration project, which is scheduled later this year (2020). CM’s contextual expertise was instrumental in streamlining and simplifying the card carrier creation process. Further, it provided liberty for the client to work with their own data, rather than waiting for the vendor’s decision. It was all because of the CM’s sensible identification of the gaps in the existing setup and delivering the right solution!

"Statistical Analysis System (SAS) is an analytics platform for advanced analytics, business intelligence, predictive analytics, and data mining. This analytics platform enjoyed high importance since it’s a one-stop analytics platform for performing predictive modeling, business intelligence data, and reporting. Business processes largely depend upon this platform usage.

A large auto finance company business group such as Risk Analytics, Insurance Analytics, Profitability Analytics, Accounting, Sales and Marketing, and BI Customer Analytics used SAS (SAS 9.3) for various analytics, modeling, and reporting processes. Jude was employed as a Chief-IT officer for the client. He noticed that the legacy on-prem SAS platform caused missing functionalities with current statistical/functional standards, missing technology components, and compatibility issues. This essentially required an upgrade (SAS 9.4 M6) to the latest and sophisticated system and with organization vision to move to the cloud. Jude requested TCS to support them on the upgrade and migration from on-prem to the cloud.

Prosenjit Chandra discussed the issue with Client Manager and Business Point of Contacts and addressed the challenges to re-design the platform and build the application on AWS. Prosenjit was associated with the client for more than eight years and gained an in-depth knowledge of analytics systems, business processes, and infrastructure. Based on the experience, he architected, designed, and built the new platform on cloud for better usability and more enhanced functionalities that were quite useful for business processes.

Prosenjit had played multiple roles such as Sr. Developer, Architect, and SAS Administrator in the client’s Risk and Governance, Accounting, and Tax area. It helped him to learn and gain knowledge of business-critical SAS analytics platforms, processes, and data integration between multiple external and internal applications of the client. Through his journey, Prosenjit learned that the current SAS System was prone to issues with a lot of ongoing vulnerabilities and potential risks. His knowledge of the client’s system and their architecture helped him to design new solutions on the cloud platform based upon the organization’s roadmap. Based on the detailed analysis, Prosenjit created an architecture proposal of cloud migration and upgraded the application to replace the current system. The architecture was based upon AWS cloud functionalities, inter-dependencies between different data source systems and interfacing applications. His knowledge in terms of technical and Risk business processes helped to create the proper design and build the app.

The new AWS cloud SAS 9.4 M6 platform leveraged analytics, data management, automation, reporting techniques to develop the latest system. Various business analytics groups successfully used the platform upgrade after implementation within the organization. The cloud features/techniques significantly reduced cost and ongoing maintenance components such as one-time cost of On-prem Pure storage (SSD) cost that accounted for almost $266K. Eliminating manual intervention helped reducing human hours to a significant level.

"Statistical Analysis System (SAS) is an analytics platform for advanced analytics, business intelligence, predictive analytics, and data mining. This analytics platform enjoyed high importance since it’s a one-stop analytics platform for performing predictive modeling, business intelligence data, and reporting. Business processes largely depend upon this platform usage.

A large auto finance company business group such as Risk Analytics, Insurance Analytics, Profitability Analytics, Accounting, Sales and Marketing, and BI Customer Analytics used SAS (SAS 9.3) for various analytics, modeling, and reporting processes. Jude was employed as a Chief-IT officer for the client. He noticed that the legacy on-prem SAS platform caused missing functionalities with current statistical/functional standards, missing technology components, and compatibility issues. This essentially required an upgrade (SAS 9.4 M6) to the latest and sophisticated system and with organization vision to move to the cloud. Jude requested TCS to support them on the upgrade and migration from on-prem to the cloud.

Prosenjit Chandra discussed the issue with Client Manager and Business Point of Contacts and addressed the challenges to re-design the platform and build the application on AWS. Prosenjit was associated with the client for more than eight years and gained an in-depth knowledge of analytics systems, business processes, and infrastructure. Based on the experience, he architected, designed, and built the new platform on cloud for better usability and more enhanced functionalities that were quite useful for business processes.

Prosenjit had played multiple roles such as Sr. Developer, Architect, and SAS Administrator in the client’s Risk and Governance, Accounting, and Tax area. It helped him to learn and gain knowledge of business-critical SAS analytics platforms, processes, and data integration between multiple external and internal applications of the client. Through his journey, Prosenjit learned that the current SAS System was prone to issues with a lot of ongoing vulnerabilities and potential risks. His knowledge of the client’s system and their architecture helped him to design new solutions on the cloud platform based upon the organization’s roadmap. Based on the detailed analysis, Prosenjit created an architecture proposal of cloud migration and upgraded the application to replace the current system. The architecture was based upon AWS cloud functionalities, inter-dependencies between different data source systems and interfacing applications. His knowledge in terms of technical and Risk business processes helped to create the proper design and build the app.

The new AWS cloud SAS 9.4 M6 platform leveraged analytics, data management, automation, reporting techniques to develop the latest system. Various business analytics groups successfully used the platform upgrade after implementation within the organization. The cloud features/techniques significantly reduced cost and ongoing maintenance components such as one-time cost of On-prem Pure storage (SSD) cost that accounted for almost $266K.

"Storing data in the cloud so as to pull it at any point of time at the location of choice has become a common industry trend at this point. Chris, the CTO at a leading US bank, was also aware of the same. His bank served millions of customers and had recently gone through a phase of acquisitions in order to scale business. This acquisition spree meant that the bank had a considerably large amount of customer data as than before. The problem lay in the maintenance of the systems. On top of it, legacy processing meant that the bank had longer maintenance windows on weekends.

The challenge for the banks was to minimize the maintenance window and keep systems available for customers. Along with it, the bank also wanted to increase the system availability so that the customers could perform bank transactions 24/7. Over and above all this, the bank also wanted to remove any Single Point of Failure (SPOF) for online files. Since many of the bank's applications ran online, all of the challenges had to be met with minimum impact to business operations.

It was in this scenario that Chris approached TCS for a solution and this marked the entry of Ramu Kristam. Ramu had been working with the bank since 2014, and hence had perfect and in-depth knowledge of the applications and systems environment involved in the operations. Currently, Ramu was the on-site coordinator working on a Disaster Recovery project. Employing his vast experience in the field, Ramu first gathered information on all application online files and their owning regions.

It came to light that different types of file products were used with different categories of files in like entry sequential, key sequential etc. Although Database was being used, it was very limited. The information gathered led to Ramu using VSAM-RLS which enabled record level sharing across systems thus increasing availability of online files for transaction updates. The existing system was changed to remove files from file Owing regions and directly define them in application regions. Since multiple application regions has files defined as local, application files were now available even if one region is down due to maintenance activity, reducing the down time. Further, file control cards were updated according to the new RLS standards.

The solution given was Ramu also removed the weekly reorganization that saved 2 hours per weekend and accelerated weekend batches, making system available sooner to customers. Overly impressed by the solution, the bank gave the go-ahead for high availability changes for all Tier 1 and Tier 2 applications. Other than Ramu being showered with praises, TCS also gained as it now has more than 40 associates working on the project that brings in revenue in excess of $1 million annually.",Maintenance Solutions For Evergrowing Customer Data,Arindam Adhikari,Retail Banking,Legacy Transformation,Cost & Optimization,Item,3
"Su* is a millennial who expects a streamlined banking process that not only helps her to perform transactions but also provides the right recommendations based on her personal interest and past history. When she signed up for a credit card with a leading bank, she was disappointed with the non-availability of recommendations and escalated the same to the financial company.

Wang*, the CTO, saw benefits in this suggestion and after some research, wanted to move the existing Card Data warehouse (CDW) and Bank Data Warehouse (BDW) to EAP - the latest Big Data platform. But this was not easy because there is little expertise in this emerging technology and Wang was finding it difficult to recruit the right talent.

Finally, he approached TCS for help and this project was assigned to Tirumala Raju Sampathirao as he had expertise in EAP and was already familiar with the client's processes and operations. This was a big project that had many sub-programs/modules such as SAS migration, creation of a Data Lake in EAP for CDW and BDW for different stakeholders, creation of real-time dashboards using real-time data, merchant recommendation engine, net new money, and more.

With his contextual knowledge and experience, Raju took on this huge project and used a methodical approach to develop each of the sub-systems. He leveraged his understanding of the client's processes and had discussions with different stakeholders before creating a blueprint for the entire big data transformation. Moreover, he understood the underlying merchant master data and transaction data which has been processed in the systems for years. To top it all, he managed to understand the complete legacy data model and the frameworks in the current system which essentially helped him draft a good solution.

Along with his team, Raju created a machine learning-based algorithm that used the card transaction data and merchant master data to generate personalized offers and real-time recommendations. This was possible only because of Raju's contextual knowledge in the cards, transactions and merchant data models. Also, the CDW and BDW migration to EAP involved the creation of a huge number of HIVE tables. Again, Raju used his understanding of the end-to-end flow of current cards and bank data model in EDW, types of files used in the system such as a full, incremental, transaction or history file, and data models to design HIVE tables. He also extensively used his domain expertise of Korean card transactions market to implement the big data transformation within the stipulated time.

As a result of this transformation, the client was able to offer personalized and real-time recommendations to every customer and this led to $512 million in incremental revenue. Also, it reduced costs in the areas of Hadoop cluster usage, increased the efficiency of batch processing, and provided a real-time dashboard for quick control. Raju received tons of praise and accolades from the client and TCS for implementing such a complex project and paved the way for more such engagements for TCS.",Implementing Big Data Transformation,"M, Mr. KARTHEKEYAN (Karthekeyan)",Cards,Application Migration,Growth & Transformation,Item,2
"Swamy was heading the Sales for an American multinational investment bank and financial services corporation headquartered in New York City. Swamy’s team was facing challenges in maintaining Salesforce, a CRM application used by all other branches in different countries for their CCB agents. All the offices were using the Salesforce in compliance with the company’s business process, regulatory requirements, and lending management systems integration country-wise. Delay in collating the data hampered the generation of reports and thereby a delayed dashboard.

Swamy approached TCS for a solution and Chandra Kumar (Chandra) was assigned to the project. Chandra was already associated with the company’s Salesforce CRM team as a developer and was aware of the Sales team’s working style. The company had engaged a third-party vendor who failed to deliver the required solution. So TCS additionally had to restructure its resources globally to deliver the project needs. The challenge was to deliver the same customized product to both the US and Mexico regions. In some of these regions required integration with a legacy global lending management application. The data integration involved the lending team for analyses and approval of the credit packages from the CRM systems. Chandra analyzed the processes and scope of optimizations/automation.






Chandra proposed to build a single Salesforce for both the US and Mexico regions for an optimized investment in both regions. The proposal also included a design to build a platform with a common set of capabilities and processes for maximum efficiency of operations in both countries. In such an instance Mexico would have to adopt the US capabilities and processes (unless required) resulting in minimized customizations.

He further decided to migrate the MX classic to US lightning Salesforce, leveraging the existing systematic interface for improved automation and avoidance of manual interfaces. This would help in migration of the existing/custom analytical capabilities to the global Einstein dashboards.

Swamy gave his approval for the implementation. Chandra delivered the final product within the stipulated time helping Swamy’s company comply with the global standards of competition. CRM best practices and businesses were able to effectively use the information to create strategies and eventually expand their Salesforce along with improving internal processes, speed and reliability. Business process knowledge and understanding of the processes were essential to support the growing business needs.
Banking/lending activities are distinct for each banking institution. Chandra helped the company achieve and exceed their goals with a set of managed and newly deployed systems. They work along the lines to add value and efficiency to the company’s business processes and goals.

Swamy and his team appreciated Chandra for the scalable solutions delivered on time. Chandra had experience in training Relationship Managers on business processes related to CRM application and other integrated systems/features. Business/lending processes are core essentials to support Salesforce and implement further enhancements. The process requires a specialized professional to gain a thorough knowledge of the features of the CRM system and the capacity to support business end-users (sales team) to achieve their respective results.

Good interpersonal and technical skills and a thorough knowledge of the business process are required to handle the no. of particularities involved.",Migration From Mx Classic To Us Lightning Salesforce,SHAROAN Mohammed,Commercial Banking,Digital Transformation,Growth & Transformation,Item,3
"The CEO of a leading Mexican bank, Pedro Ramírez López, in 2019 decided that the firm urgently needed performance engineering support to ensure quality delivery of services and keep ahead of competition. He directed the IT head to call for RFPs and TCS sent in its proposal. It proposed to provide FMS service on performance engineering and prepared a statement of work (SOW). Pedro accepted the proposal and requested TCS to supply performance engineers for onsite delivery of services.

That meant TCS would get to take control of Performance Engineering Business of the bank entirely. But the challenge before the consultancy was finding or creating about 28 Mexican performance engineers within two months to manage services delivery entirely. The recruitment also had to be done without slippage in delivery. The bank itself felt the target was impossible to achieve and that there would be tremendous escalation of costs over delivery issues.

For TCS, non-delivery was never an option. And it deployed an entire team headed by associate Sandipan Sikder to deliver success. Sandipan had worked for the bank for six years in Mexico and knew the organization, its expectations, work culture, and technical landscape well. He was backed by 13 years of experience in performance engineering and had solutions to any problem with delivery. Besides, Sandipan was aware of the local culture and had working knowledge of Spanish, which helped him gain client confidence.

Nonetheless, as TCS Mexico did not have a pool of performance engineers, it had to recruit talent or groom internal associates. The challenge was made steeper as Mexico had few performance resources with right skillset who were bilingual. The process was constantly managed by a team comprising associates Sowgath, Debajyoti, Shamik, and Thiyagarajan. Local leads also joined hands with TCS to deliver success.

Sandipan had been working as a service delivery lead during the FMS phase and knew that the bank was dissatisfied with the security of the system. He knew major challenges were faced from the outgoing vendor, language dependency, and expected metrics of work which the clients were used to.
Sandipan took 80 percent of Quality Assurance resources from TCS pool and involved them in assessing business requirement and creation of workload. In parallel, he assisted them with carrying on technical tasks. Every task was reviewed and delivery assured with the help of offshore support. Some professionals were also tagged to the QA team to bridge technical gaps in delivery.

Over six months, these resources began brining profit to the company and were equipped to deliver projects on their own. Delivery of results satisfied the bank even when the FMS was nearly at 85 percent. The confidence earned is expected to land TCS a more profitable business relationship with the bank in future.",Leveraging Business Expertise For Engineering Support,Sunil John,Cards,Technology Infrastructure,Cost & Optimization,Item,1
"The CTO of a leading bank in the U.S was looking through the reports and had been in intense discussions with some of the IT managers. The problem was that a critical Machine Learning system in the organisation had reached its theoretical maximum and was thus having low predictive power. Though some of the IT teams had been working on fine-tuning the model architecture, it did not have a significant impact on the capacity of the system. Also, the presence of many haphazard pipelines limited the reusability of modules and this further hampered the scalability of the system to handle large volumes of data.

TCS had been helping this client across many areas and so, the CTO turned to TCS once again to fix this problem. Manoj Kumar Chellappa was assigned this project because he was an expert in machine learning, NLP, and Python enterprise coding skills. More importantly, he had a thorough understanding of this machine learning system as he had worked in the core preprocessing engine of the client. He also knew the contents and possibilities hidden in the inputs to this model, and all of this knowledge and experience, made him the right choice to handle this complex project.

With this contextual knowledge and expertise in machine learning, Manoj quickly understood that the model had reached its theoretical limit and hence, suggested and implemented a slew of solutions to improve its efficiency. He identified 30,000 records for training, added new features for documents that were hidden deep in the core JSON and changed the modelling architecture from one level to multiple levels. Along with these changes, he also automated the entire process by creating four reusable pipelines which saved many man-days and thus, shorted the modelling lifecycle as a whole. All the above solutions increased the model’s accuracy by 20% from the baseline performance.

The client appreciated the solutions provided and has started to empower and encourage TCS associates to take charge and control of new use cases and ramp up the team.

Richard- the Operations Manager had to go live into production with OPTOUT changes by Jan 1, 2020, as the penalty amounts were very high and penalties could range from $2,500 for a non-intentional violation to $7,500 for an intentional violation. They needed a designed end-to-end automated solution that was both in-expensive to build and would take 6 months to go live.

As part of CCPA compliance law the customer had to implement the below for the OPTOUT process: Streamlining and automation of the intake and fulfillment of consumer requests for personal information, utilization of CCPA-specific response templates to help reply to requests and allowing of consumers to opt-out of the sale of personal information through a clear and conspicuous link on website and customer service channels. TCS had been the most trusted partner for them and was entrusted with finding an alternate solution to be implemented, which would be economical, short to implement but would cover all the requirements.

"The Client was a Global Bank with multiple portfolios like risk, finance, and compliance. The compliance area had multiple sub-portfolios like the Anti Money Laundering (AML) Transaction monitoring and case management, investigation applications in NAM and LATAM.

Jacob*, The Technical Head was worried about the functioning of a few processes. Applications in the AML monitoring area were the bank’s last defence in the compliance segment to screen any suspicious transactions in each line of business including consumer, commercial, private and institutional banking.

There were numerous activities, which required manual intervention and they were naturally prone to human errors. Also, there was no offshore model due to data restrictions and other challenges, creating full dependency on onshore resources. On top of that, due to strict regulatory requirements, there were several manual controls followed by internal audits in this very special line of business. Jacob decided to involve TCS in the process.

Koushik Datta approached Jacob with an idea of offshoring a significant portion of activities after conducting a thorough cost-benefit analysis. The offshore model was necessary to cope up with the business needs to support the applications on a 24*7 basis. The challenge was to comply with the data privacy regulations that still applied to cross border data sharing.

He also proposed several automation proposals to reduce manual dependencies. Within a few months, he implemented a state of the art proactive health check and system monitoring for all the applications, including auto watch portal to monitor inbound and outbound feeds, app dynamics to monitor system health, URL status and disk space usage, and an efficient alert mechanism through autosys scheduling, etc

Koushik had worked with the bank leadership team and technology teams to segregate the data by creating views and roles and later implemented it in an optimal technical solution to provide non-restricted data access offshore. He also created several automated scripts, which could be executed from a job scheduling portal and would not require direct access to production servers. This way he ensured a smooth transition of the many server maintenance activities offshore.

Jacob initially was concerned over the offshore transition and had doubts over the knowledge transition. However, after the successful transition, he realized the benefits of a 24*7 offshore model and Koushik was able to gain the customer confidence to improve the offshore-onshore ratio.
He streamlined the entire offshore transition and within a year he maintained a stable offshore team. The model helped both TCS and the Bank to reduce the operating cost to run the project as well as reduce the non-business working hours for the US-based resources and in turn increasing productivity.

Another benchmark achievement was adaptability to new technologies and the frameworks. Many applications were migrated to the Big Data platform and vendor products like Mantas and Actimize were upgraded to higher versions. Most of the migrations and upgrades happened after TCS took over. Koushik led the team to adapt to the changes quickly and ensured the smooth delivery to the business stakeholders and users despite multiple challenges during the migration.

"The Client was a banking firm having a global reach and appeal. There were multiple channels at the bank for opening a retail consumer account like Digital (Online and Mobile), Call center and Branch. All of these channels needed to show the promotional rates and interest rates before opening the account. Along with the introduction of Flexible pricing (interest rates and promotions based on the residential state), all the channels had to make use of a common service to get the state, governing state and pricing flag based on the entered zip code. There were already Digital, Call center and branch channels using the service at its capacity.

George- the Technical Head could envision the issue that the already onboarded channels using the service with high usage and more channels would be onboarded which would increase the turn-around time of the service with possible impact on its availability in case of heavy traffic. The challenge was not just to maintain the response time of the service but also to improve it while continuing to onboard new channels that would bring in more traffic. Failing to onboard new channels without improving the performance drastically would mean a degraded performance at the least and unavailability (due to time outs) in worst cases would result in the customers, not seeing the rates at all. The challenges were sufficient to warrant an immediate need to redesign the service.

Laxman Chouhan had been a part of the project since its initiation and well aware of business needs, challenges, systems and infrastructure involved. He also had worked in different teams for the client which helped him understand how all systems are connected. He was chosen as the head of the project.






He worked closely on the flexible pricing project to fully understand the problem and analyze the origin of the case. The root cause discovered was the integration with the Oracle database to query the DB for each call. There was an additional microservice- hop and then a database call, both of which were added to the overall response time.

Having worked on the Digital projects, he was aware of the non-relational MongoDB which was added to the team infrastructure which could be leveraged for faster reading from the database as compared to the relational Oracle database. Also, the client was looking to get away from the Oracle DB dependency altogether for all requirements. The service was then redesigned to prevent the additional hops and for the movement of the data from Oracle to Mongo DB. Contents of the database were loaded in memory at startup and returned from memory.

The performance test gave confidence to onboard new channels for the service. Also, the approach removed the dependency on OracleDB enabling the client to decommission the servers once other services using it were cut off from OracleDB which was one of the goals of the client.
This improvement was quite appreciated and received with welcoming hands by the client. Laxman was lauded for his efforts and was promoted within TCS.

"The Client was a banking organization who had customers located all across the globe. The CCPA provided California consumers with a private right of action in connection with a breach of non-encrypted or non-redacted personal information that resulted in a violation of reasonable security practices or procedures. The bill took effect on January 1, 2020, and companies could be penalized for violations with a 30-day period to address the non-compliance issue.

Rupert- The Operations Manager knew that they were running against time to implement an end to end solution against changing requirements to be compliant with the law. The main challenge for the client was to build a robust solution against changing requirements. Amendments to the law caused the change in requirements which caused many issues. If the project did not go live, then the client could be penalized up to $7500 per customer for violations and also the client reputation was at stake. Rupert decided to call TCS for help.

Sudharsan Krishnan who had worked with the client on a previous project was assigned with the task to implement a robust solution under these challenging conditions. The challenge with the implementation was the timeline and the constantly changing requirements. A number of moving parts like acquiring resources and setting up infra for the new application, working with multiple teams and the short timeline to deliver the solution made it complex for him and the team. He had vast experience in delivering complex projects and had knowledge of the client’s process timelines, operating environments and execution models. This helped him in preparing the application to support various changing needs of the legal teams.


Sudharsan Krishnan worked as the project lead. He did the groundwork to understand the end to end business requirements. He also analyzed the possible solutions to resolve the client’s problem. Having worked with the client he could identify solutions for the pain points and plan the delivery timeline effectively. He suggested the solution to have control points to overcome the changing requirements challenges and laid out the delivery plan by backtracking from the project release timeline. The implementation was carefully planned to perfection with a controlled rollout which received appreciation from the stakeholders. Business and technical knowledge combined with analytical skills helped in arriving at the solution. TCS helped Sudarshan to mentally prepare for the challenge. TCS Fresco Play courses helped with designing robust architectural solutions for the requirement.

The final gratification was to see the project Go-Live after all the challenges. The solution changed the mindset of the client. The client was impressed by the solution and appreciated Sudarshan and his team for providing the best solution under challenging conditions.
The client appreciated the commitment shown towards the delivery of the project and the willingness showcased by Sudarshan to look for solutions to guide the rest of the team to find the right solution. The flagship project was yet another milestone for the Client-TCS relationship.

"The Client was a global bank having a loyal customer base. The KYC (Know Your Customer) was one of the critical applications for the bank with over 15,000+ users globally. KYC had different application instances in 7 regions (NAM, LATAM, EMEA, APAC, IDN, KR & MX).

Miguel*, The Technical Head was keen on expanding the business with the application. However, the application was receiving 100 user incidents daily and there were close to 1000+ backlog incidents reported by his team. There was a huge pressure on the production support team from the business to close the backlog tickets. This is when Miguel thought of approaching TCS to take over the support from a different vendor.

KYC was a vast application with many functional modules that had different business rules. All new team members were learning the application spending extra hours at work to cope with the demand from business. Backlog incidents had to be addressed immediately to gain client confidence which was also important for the client’s business. TCS took over the project support in the compliance line of business for 2018.



Bhanu Prakash was an employee of TCS who had been the Onshore Sub Delivery Manager for KYC and he took the responsibility to drive the team and yield good results. He had encountered a similar problem while working in the Anti Money Laundering (AML) support team for another client. With that expertise, he started digging for a solution for the problem in hand.

He held a series of meetings with SMEs in onshore, offshore and nearshore teams to identify a smart and quick solution to address the backlogs in a short period. He came up with a couple of action points- identify incidents owner for each region and group incidents according to the issue. The plan was crafted in 3 days for the incident closure.

60% of incidents were resolved in 4 weeks which brought down the backlog incident count considerably. As they proceeded further, difficult incidents were discovered which brought down the resolution rate. To solve this Bhanu and his team worked extra hours during weekends to accelerate the resolution rate and by the end of the 2nd month, the backlog incidents were reduced by 80%.

Bhanu was able to bring the backlog incidents count to less than 50 in 3 months which was an all-time low in the history of KYC. He received many accolades from the business and also from the client which helped TCS in a big way in gaining the best partner title. The KYC support team became a role model within compliance that paved a path for other applications to address backlog incidents in a very short period.

"The Client was a global bank having a loyal customer base. The check payment processing was causing issues for them. Paper-based payments processing (check payments) and generating controlled disbursements notification to corporate customers was a key liquidity management solution offered by the client. Automated image quality analysis of checks was a key process in the application where more than a billion dollars were processed daily. Michael*- The Head of the Operations Team reviewed the check image quality rejects to identify false positives and reprocess the check payments the next business day. Reprocessing of rejected check payments involved manual printing and scanning of rejected checks using legacy check scanners. There was a need for an operator to be physically present in the office to scan the rejects in the legacy check scanners. The COVID-19 situation posed a greater challenge to

Michael and his team to manage the logistics and to send an operator to the office during the pandemic. There was also an additional cost involved in the necessary storage, maintenance, and support for those mammoth legacy scanning machines. Michael was finding it very difficult to handle the issue and hence he reached out to TCS. A separate outdated infrastructure had to be maintained and supported by TCS teams to operate the legacy scanners.

Manojj had a profound understanding of the bank’s end to end corporate check payments processing flow, application landscape, and upstream and downstream partner processes. During the three years stint with the bank, Manojj gained an in-depth understanding of the check processing business and its dependencies. He created a synergy working with the operators from the TCS BPS organization and became fully aware of the day to day operational processes and the challenges faced by the operators. He had a penchant towards solving day to day operational difficulties and suggested multiple ideas to automate and reduce human errors in the end to end process.

He analyzed the rejected check entries in the application and identified ways to extract them automatically without missing the integrity to reprocess them. He did a proof of concept to convince the clients to build a simple user interface for operators to review the rejected checks and reprocess them. With the help of the development team, he built a lightweight user interface application to review rejected check entries and created an automated process to reintroduce them back into the processing flow without the need for manual printing and scanning in the legacy scanners. The entire application development and implementation were done following the agile methodology which enabled faster time to market. By automating the whole rejected check payment processing, the need for an operator to be physically present in the office was eliminated. The user interface could be accessed by the operator working from home.

The maintenance and support of the legacy scanners which required an outdated infrastructure were also eliminated. The automation of the process enabled operators to reprocess the checks in the same business day and thereby eliminated the financial risk to the bank. Given the pandemic situation across the world, the solution built by Manojj and his team helped the clients to not send operators to the office to complete a key business process. With this solution, the same business process could be completed seamlessly and efficiently from the comfort of the operator’s home by accessing the newly built application through the client’s infrastructure. His work was appreciated by Michael and his seniors, they renewed their contracts with TCS for new advanced projects.",Automating The Check Payment Process,"M, Mr. KARTHEKEYAN (Karthekeyan)",Payments,Automation,Cost & Optimization,Item,1
"The Client was a leading bank dealing with customers spread all across the globe. Retail fraud dealt with consumer cards and evaluation of fraud risk on customers' accounts. The existing process would inform the customers about potential fraud transactions(PFT) on their card/accounts through text/voice/email channels.

In the process, Fraud Operations had been handling a high volume of inbound customer calls, due to customers trying to understand the reported transaction and they tried to work it out with an agent to confirm potential fraud. This incurred a very high operating cost for the client. Richard- the operations manager wanted to enable the self-servicing capability to the customers over their online channels thereby reducing the Ops cost and for this purpose he contacted TCS.

Saikat Natta took up the task to address the issue, by implementing a solution to help customers self-service PFT and reduce Ops cost by an estimated $120K annually. He had a sound functional knowledge of the Fraud business and operations and had been with the Client’s Retail Fraud technology for over 5 years. The solution designed by him could facilitate online front end apps to interact with Retail Fraud backend and provide details of customers' transactions and propagate the potential fraud risk assessment; based on which front end apps could provide necessary details to customers for them to self-service a potential fraud scenario on their card/transactions.



It was a challenge to understand the Digital processes and conventions and to work accordingly to design a technical solution that could bridge between a Digital world and a legacy backend system. What was even more challenging was Digital NGA was on cloud architecture, while the fraud backend was Legacy server-based; so the environment needs were very different.

There was a challenge to not interrupt the existing FICO channel customer interaction and not add any redundancy due to the addition of an online self-service option. This initiative had a very steep project timeline, which required Saikat to gain knowledge of new NGA technologies and software related to SCM, CI-CD and PCF cloud that was not part of the retail fraud system roadmap before.

The solution was implemented by JAN 2020, months before the expectation. The Client was highly impressed with the solution and expressed high regard for the extensive efforts that Saikat and his team had to put to deliver in steep timelines. His efforts helped engrave TCS as the leading technology service provider.

"The Client was one of the leading financial services organizations in the US servicing across banking, insurance, cards, and real estate under one umbrella. They had diversified into the retail cards business with the acquisition of Sears’s credit card business and expanded to many more big retailers like Home Depot, Macy's, and many more.

S4 Collections was one of the departments which enrolled and managed the lifecycle of a collections/forbearance account by working closely with ACS and Fiserv to ensure our processes were SOX compliant. If there was any break in the process it caused compliance, legal and regulatory complaints, which caused a loss in trustworthiness and revenue for the client.

Peter* - The SVP of Retail Services group was getting loads of complaints from his juniors about compliance and regulatory issues faced in the S4 forbearance and non-forbearance collections processes. This was majorly due to the lack of auto recover mechanism of Fiserv transactions for any failures with the host system. Also, there was tight coupling in creating input records for the collections system by merging the batch files from many upstream teams, which caused delays in processing the forbearance and non-forbearance offers. Peter was worried about the direct loss of revenue because of SOX compliances and was losing sleep over regaining customer's confidence. To avoid more damage he decided to call TCS.

Venkata Balakrishna Martha had been working with the client for 8 years across offshore and onsite locations and had gained in-depth knowledge of their business, IT landscape, environment topography, and the surrounding systems. Bala’s rich technical knowledge in the Java/J2EE technologies, system framework was a bonus to overcome the challenges swiftly.

The goal was to build a robust decision system to handle the downtime to provide seamless transaction processing and to avoid any potential errors by placing strong internal controls. Bala and the team started their brainstorming, analyzed multiple solutions to address the issue, and finally zeroed in to provide an in-house solution to handle all failure transactions by enabling the auto-recovery mechanism. Bala realized that the information of cardholders that was handpicked by the system could provide data needed for the decision process. The team faced challenges in understanding the topography of different systems built in different technologies but with Bala’s knowledge, the issue was conquered.

Bala and team developed ‘Collections fulfillment GTM - An In-house Engine’ which would process the collections transactions with an auto-recovery mechanism through the RedHat business process model, which seamlessly reduced the data transmission errors. He also implemented internal alerts and error report mechanisms on all transactions received per day to stakeholders daily along with BAU reports, which improved the transparency and quality of the system.

Peter was amazed by the solution provided by Bala and the team and the way it was seamlessly implemented accommodating all their clientele individual requirements The implemented systems process execution involved auto-recovery during data transmission errors. Automated notifications to business owners for any discrepancies found in the system minimized the compliance and regulatory issues by taking prompt action on the gaps identified in business functionality.

"The Client, a Customer Business Group, was facing challenges with their legacy acquisition systems (Credit Initiation and Decision). They were not able to cope up with their business competitors to provide best-in-class services for their new product launches. Besides, they were also facing issues as they had to maintain multiple legacy tech stacks to keep their operations running. This resulted in high maintenance cost overheads and an inability to support future volume projections. The feedback from the customers was not favorable.

Rupert, Technical Chief Consultant, was in touch with the Marketing team who had a few complaints. They explained their problems in detail. They wished to provide better services for their new launches but were unable to do so because of problems in the legacy systems. As the processing time of applications took long, they were at risk of missing commitments to their external partners which led to the Client paying penalty to the partners. They were losing the advantage of talking to customers first about new ideas, thereby losing the momentum for the Client.

Delays in implementing strategies affected their business opportunities. The competitors had an edge even with a substandard product simply because they were ahead of others. Rupert realized that the need of the hour was to re-engineer their legacy systems, but they were not equipped with the right talent to make the decisions and build the new system. Hence, he reached out to their IT partner, TCS for help. Anurag Agarwal, who had played the role of Solution Architect for several other projects for the customer was unanimously recommended for rebuilding the credit initiation system.

Anurag had to work with the business representatives from multiple lines of business. It was highly challenging for Anurag to convince them to agree on common requirements to build a go-to common platform. He was also having challenges to convince the customers to follow a phased approach for the delivery to minimize waste. But, by leveraging his contextual knowledge, Anurag worked with the stakeholders, explained the benefits of the suggested approach and got their agreement. Anurag came up with the right framework and software tools to be used for building the new system. He designed the overall flow of the new system by having a flexible architecture that would meet the current requirements and allow future enhancements. He included deployment flexibility in his design so that business could roll out their changes without much dependency on the IT team.

Soon after the Phase-1 roll-out of the program, the client was able to see the benefits of the new system. The new system was well received by the client’s operations team and the positive feedback kept coming from the service agents as well. The time taken for decisions was reduced to as low as 2 seconds. The business was able to roll out changes for the new partner and product onboarding took less time. All this converted into increased savings for the Client. Anurag Agarwal truly gave that competitive edge to the Client by transforming their legacy acquisition systems into a state-of-the art common platform.",Consolidation Of Multiple Acquisition Systems For Improving Product Launches,SHARMILEE PRAKASH,Cards,Legacy Transformation,Growth & Transformation,Item,1

They were able to process close to four petabytes of data for several US Federal regulatory reportings like CCAR, FDIC, IFRS, BASEL, etc. Moving their ETL engine from Ab-initio and Oracle to Bigdata gave them huge cost benefits both from reducing storage costs from Oracle and ETL engine from Ab-initio.

The Technical team faced some challenges during this transition. Each technology was giving data fabrication layer and job monitoring individually, but when it came to resolving issues in production, significant time and effort were required from their global production assurance to figure out the issue. This was because there was not a single end- to- end process monitoring tool across the retail platform. As a BFS organization, every day the profit and loss and the general ledger report had to be sent to the CEO at 7 pm sharp. Each business day had strict SLA for its regulatory reporting. There were more than 200 data sources spread across continents. Missing a single minute cost a huge SLA breach and the concerned person was answerable to the CEO. TCS was approached to help them sort this issue.

Subhamoy Chowdhury of TCS, who joined this project as a Developer was selected as the Head of this project. He was already associated with the client for the last 5 years was aware of the end- to- end ETL and reporting layer architecture. He had a good understanding of how the data was flowing across one ecosystem to the other. Over the 5 years, his role was converted to that of a Technical Manager with the responsibility of handling a team of 20 persons including offshore and onsite. Subhamoy wrote a simple shell script to monitor the health of one of the modules and showed the same in a desktop application. This became so popular that he was given the responsibility to have it across all the platforms which also worked as a catalyst to get one new project. After implementing the web-based solution, it helped the client and his higher management by having a single window for monitoring process, infrastructure, metadata into a connected path, which was previously very scattered across multiple platforms. In the event of any issue, the client could understand the source of the issue before they reached out to the Global Production Assurance team.

Post-implementation things became very easy. The number of P1 Tickets reduced significantly. This application was mainly developed for retail customers. Seeing the success of this project, the Client planned to extend the same into other business areas and new proposals started coming. The Client expressed their satisfaction after the completion of the project to TCS.",Webbased Solution To Consolidate Multiple Platforms,Sunil John,Retail Banking,Legacy Transformation,Cost & Optimization,Item,1
"The Client, a leading global bank, was facing issues since March 2019 in structuring the KYC portal accordingly with the requirements. Mark, the Marketing Head, and Derek, the Automation Chief held several discussions to find solutions to the issues which were surfacing. Know Your Customer, alternatively known as know your client or simply KYC, the process of a business verifying the identity of its clients was the key problem area. KYC was a critical function to assess customer risk and a legal requirement to comply with Anti-Money Laundering (AML) laws. Problems arose either due to data mismatch or due to functional gaps.

Mark expressed concern over the fact that due to the data flow issue, handover to business was delayed daily from KYC end and this impacted the account opening and other related processes. Derek explained that his team was facing many challenges like screening the NTB (New To Bank) profiles, User Interface not properly in sync with the client requirement, customer data not flowing from source and not visible in the user interface, data mismatch between source and user interface and a huge amount of invalid/incorrect customer data flowing in and hitting the database capacity. Thousands of closed customer accounts were flowing daily through batches due to which system slowed down considerably and database capacity was impacted. Derek further went on to elaborate that the current KYC structure was newly introduced into the banking system of the client. The data flow from the source to user interface involved multiple checkpoints where various functions like risk calculation, Next Due Date calculation, screening of profiles, etc happened before the final tested customer data was available to makers/checkers/approvers for processing. Mark and Derek concluded that they needed external help and expertise to bail them out of this existing situation. They approached TCS, who designated Nilanjan Chatterjee to take charge of this project.

Nilanjan Chatterjee and his team worked with the Client’s teams and identified many developmental gaps in the processes and started addressing them one by one. Coordination was required within various teams involved in processing the batch from source to UI. Unwanted data was identified and restricted from the source to improve the batch performance and reduce handover time to the business team. Extensive RCA was carried out and issues like mismatch in Next Due Date, Data Not Flowing (Source Of Wealth, Customer Details, etc) and incorrect risk calculation were rectified in UAT and replicated in production. This improved data quality and reduced user incidents to a great extent.


Nilanjan also identified areas where there was the scope of automation to reduce manual intervention and human error. This was one of the major reasons for the malfunctioning of the system. He worked with the Automation team and automated a few modules due to which the overall performance improved to a great extent. A user interactive Chatbot system was introduced to create incidents and this also helped to resolve user queries immediately.

"The Customer was one of the world’s largest providers of credit card and bank card products. They were the industry leaders in the North American region with 2.5 percent of GDP spent using its credit cards and an estimated 10% of Card sales transacted online. It had a customer base of about 200 million in the US alone.

Justin*, The Operations Manager was aware of the technological advancements in the industry. He was excited to introduce a new Co-Branded card with one of the major US wholesale retail chains. But the changes were exquisite. It was about to change the entire card structure.

With this project, the bank was about to implement the concept of an individual physical device with a separate card number of each relationship along with co-branding intended to enable easy transactions with the retail chain as well as a new rewarding system that could be encashed at the retail point of sale. Hence Justin had pinned a large hope on this program's success within a stipulated time frame. He approached TCS to help them with the project.

Rituparna was chosen to handle this project due to her prior entanglement with the client. She studied the requirements and understood the project objectives. She became more clear about the estimate and hence TCS onboarded more members for each concerned application. Detailed targeted transition sessions were arranged by the team to bring them up to pace for the project. The initial phase of the project amounted to a whopping 7000 plus test script. She proposed a Risk-Based testing approach for meeting project deliverables within the timeline. Accordingly, all functionalities were segregated based on criticality from a business perspective.

After the script construction phase was completed and reviewed successfully, the team confronted a new issue with the test data conditioning. The credit card offer functionalities required extensive testing for all cardholder relationships which created a dearth of testable data. Rituparna came up with a proper improvement idea of an automated script that would run unmanned during offshore night hours and pull up all the existing offers in the account so that the team could use those same accounts the next day. This saved a huge hour loss in the test data hunting of approximately 2 resources a day and helped expedite the execution pace.

Her team had to endure several consecutive weekends of support to achieve the target. Rituparna chalked out a plan for early reporting of any issue to the concerned development and middleware teams to reduce downtime hour loss. Rituparna also handled the integration testing with bank backend and middleware systems and the retail chain backend systems.

After all these ordeals, the end of the story was a happy customer who could market the product on time. The credit card holder’s response was so prompt and spontaneous that in the initial few days customer care representatives faced a tough time and hence it was revamped with a new team to support the existing customer calls. Rituparna and the entire team got hugely applauded for their humongous effort for this program. Due to her efforts, TCS was awarded more projects by the client.",Implementing The Banks Cobranded Card System,SHAROAN Mohammed,Cards,Test Automation,Cost & Optimization,Item,1
"The Indian operation of a leading U.S. Bank was faced with a new RBI regulatory requirement in January 2020. The bank was required to gather information about Unhedged Foreign Currency Exposure (UFCE) from its corporate customers for Capital and Provisioning Requirements and submit it to the RBI. The timeline for collection and processing of information was short, with a submission deadline of first week of April. If the Bank did not submit the information on time, it risked being non-complaint. It was immensely challenging to work with truncated timelines for recruitments, entitlements, training, process flow, workflow and managing the dynamic nature of the activity.

TCS, a trusted IT vendor partner of the Bank, was put in charge of carrying out this critical activity. The information would be collected and scrutinised by the TCS team, and the consolidated data would be shared with the Bank and further with RBI. However, the activity was expected to be challenging, with truncated timelines for recruitments, entitlements, training, and creating the process flow and workflow.

Laxmi Poojari, who managed a niche process under an Indian unit of the Bank, proactively took over the additional responsibility of the regulatory submission activity. Having worked with the client for over 12 years, Laxmi had gained deep contextual knowledge about the Bank’s operations and processes. She was well versed with UFCE and other RBI regulatory requirements, given the current context of the Client.

After understanding the challenges from the transition team, Laxmi discussed the process in depth with client stakeholders. She created a roadmap to enable swift execution of activities with adequate controls. The key attributes of the roadmap were Skillset, Initiative, Performance, Opportunity, and Continuity. To reduce onboarding timelines, key internal resources with domain expertise were mobilised to execute the roles of SME/Checker, and a core team of process specialists was formed. Laxmi organised process walkthroughs, consulted client stakeholders, and created a forum for the process steps to be clarified and bottlenecks addressed.

Additionally, Laxmi expedited the onboarding, training, and ID creation process of newcomers. Her exceptional connect with other Managers helped her get the support of members from cross functional teams to work on the regulatory deliverable activity. She ensured that associates were assigned tasks according to their skillsets and seniority and that they were always motivated and productive. She nurtured a good client relationship, which helped gain the client’s confidence and trust for future prospects. Laxmi also followed Rigor in Operations with hourly collation and distribution of work by the team and thorough Maker-Checker steps followed to avoid rework.

Due to Laxmi’s exceptional leadership, the team was able to conclude regulatory information submission activity for the March and June 2020 quarters in a time bound manner. This was a critical activity from a regulatory perspective, and its completion helped the Bank with regulation compliance. The Client appreciated the dedication and commitment shown by Laxmi in completing this exercise within stringent timelines. Thus, Laxmi’s successful execution of the regulatory deliverable activity strengthened TCS’s relationship with the Client.",Operations Process Planning And Excellence Helps Us Bank With Timely Regulatory Submission,T  Sumathi,Commercial Banking,Regulatory & Compliance,Cost & Optimization,Item,1
"The Legacy system was one of the best systems that Gary had ever been involved with. But he also realised that it was failing to keep up with the times. He worked for a leading Canadian Captive Auto Finance Company, and he was now facing issues that were typical of any company that used legacy. They had disparate systems with no master data management and multiple data sources for the same data. The source systems also did not have comprehensive data validation at entry, and this compounded the issue. Gary also noticed that there was no data solution for capturing historical data.

His company was also facing issues matching reporting numbers with the transaction systems. A lot of manual intervention was required for producing any report. CXOs had very little visibility on the profitability at the contract level. Gary was not able to respond to the market needs with an effective pricing model.

Desperate for a solution, Gary connected with Viraj from TCS. Her contextual knowledge of the auto finance business and its end-to-end flow from origination to remarketing was critical to the solution. She had played multiple roles from business analysts, data analysts and more importantly, relationship manager to take care of the various stakeholders. She was able to get the vital data from them without stepping on someone else’s shoes. Knowledge of Captive Auto Finance, Data Modeling concepts and being able to work on massive data was key to the project. She also brought in sufficient contextual understanding, thanks to his subject matter expertise and experience in the field.

Viraj was assigned the task to produce profitability matrix across segments, products and other dimensions. To identify the source systems that should be utilised for data was a challenging task. Multiple layers for reporting added to the challenge for data understanding. Viraj understood from Gary that the data was not available historically, and it did not provide any trend data. Despite the obstacles, Viraj was able to frame the right hypothesis, thanks to her contextual knowledge.

Viraj understood the flow from prospects to origination to boarding, servicing and the end-of-terms. A tree diagram was constructed to capture different scenarios based on parameters. This helped in analysing the data and the ability to create metadata. Data reconciliation exercises were done to relate the transactions from the report and to go to the correct source systems.

One of the key environmental challenges was access to different data sources and also the maintenance of the legacy data framework, which was built on an expensive tool with no support. The solution consisted of building a data warehouse for profitability and business operations. Viraj created historical loan profitability-related data and reports, including relevant context that would be available for querying and creating ad hoc reports via dimensions and metrics. It started from an on-premise solution which was migrated to AWS cloud. Data modelling was the key aspect for faster and accurate data reporting.

"The Process Quality Adherence Team of the Operational Risk Control Department of an organization has been producing monthly reports detailing the analysis of non-compliance with the organizational standards. The reports helped the respective leads and the stakeholders across the organization in assessing the risks. The reports were presented in Excel and PowerPoint formats with absolutely no interactivity for the users and lacked the scope of automation. Moreover, the process was running the risk of becoming obsolete.

The organization was in need of a dynamic and interactive tool for its monthly reports to be presented to the management for a better view on risks and also help the stakeholders be aware of the non-compliance risks. Additionally, there was also a requirement for all the daily, weekly, and monthly reports of the Operational Risk Team to be automated.
When TCS was approached for a solution, they promised to get back with a robust solution that had the best-in-class reporting capabilities and a platform for a complete and non-dependent self-analysis. The idea was to de-function the legacy applications, save the time and efforts of resources, and provide the users with all the information required for a detailed analysis.



Jaikarthick (Jai), the Reporting Team Lead at TCS was assigned to the project, as he was already associated with the organization for about 8 years and had a good knowledge of the data-driven reports. His association helped in a better understanding of the reporting structure and its implications. Jai explored and analyzed different tools with the likes of SharePoint web parts, Cognos, and Qlikview and built proof of concepts to test the scalability.

After various deliberations and co-ordinations, Jai zeroed in on the ‘Tableau’. A tool that came with quick and interactive visualizations, explicit presentation of key data, ability to connect to large no. of databases and files, handling of abundant data at any given time, and was mobile-friendly. With the range of functions offered by Tableau, most of the data were seamlessly transitioned and automated. Jai was able to build dynamic and interactive dashboards, which could be customized to each department’s requirements using the built-in filters.

The Tableau servers provided the flexibility to download the basic data for each of the dashboards enabling the users to conduct data analysis at a granular level. The Tableau dashboards were the exact visual representations of the organization’s thoughts which resulted in being used for all the reports of the Operational Risk Control Department. Most of the reports were automated and a few of them were re-designed to provide clarity of the metrics to the stakeholders. The automation saved up to 40 hours a month on various report generations and the frequency for a few of them were increased from weekly to daily and bi-weekly to weekly.
Jai was appreciated and awarded in recognition of his services by the organization. Furthermore, he was also awarded Recognition certificates (an internal team award program) by TCS. He, along with his team members went on to become the SMEs in Tableau, exploring further possibilities of automating any/every report.",Tableau An Apt Solution For Automation Of Reports,AMIT KUMAR SONI,Retail Banking,Automation,Cost & Optimization,Item,2

After various deliberations and co-ordinations, Jai zeroed in on the ‘Tableau’. A tool that came with quick and interactive visualizations, explicit presentation of key data, ability to connect to large no. of databases and files, handling of abundant data at any given time, and was mobile-friendly. With the range of functions offered by Tableau, most of the data were seamlessly transitioned and automated. Jai was able to build dynamic and interactive dashboards, which could be customized to each department’s requirements using the built-in filters.

The Tableau servers provided the flexibility to download the basic data for each of the dashboards enabling the users to conduct data analysis at a granular level. The Tableau dashboards were the exact visual representations of the organization’s thoughts which resulted in being used for all the reports of the Operational Risk Control Department. Most of the reports were automated and a few of them were re-designed to provide clarity of the metrics to the stakeholders. The automation saved up to 40 hours a month on various report generations and the frequency for a few of them were increased from weekly to daily and bi-weekly to weekly.
Jai was appreciated and awarded in recognition of his services by the organization. Furthermore, he was also awarded Recognition certificates (an internal team award program) by TCS. He, along with his team members went on to become the SMEs in Tableau, exploring further possibilities of automating any/every report.",Tableau An Apt Solution For Automation Of Reports,SENTHIL Shiyalam,Retail Banking,Automation,Cost & Optimization,Item,1
"The client is one of the largest multinational banks in the world. Justin, the bank manager, wanted to work on a single goal of one team one dream. However, he was unable to get a single view of all projects as there was no single point of contact for the deliverables. The client was unable to keep tabs on the deliverables and got confused with the flow of work. Justin had to handle a lot of escalations due to the delay in delivery. He had to find a solution to this issue and ensure the monitoring of the existing and new product releases.

Justin managed the infrastructure project management in three teams, such as CTI PM, TRM, and Infra PM. He struggled to adhere to several projects with three different teams as they were not under single management and did not have single ownership or accountability. Justin's team struggled to coordinate with multiple teams to get their jobs done. This lack of coordination severely impacted the delivery timeline drastically. Justin was in need of a quick solution to address this issue. He contacted Deenadayalan, a veteran in the development platform and infrastructure management of TCS. With over 14 years of experience, Deena was an experienced platform architect in DevOps and CI/CD solution ennoblement. He had in-depth knowledge in data centers, server procurement, and networking and consumer technology application landscape.

Deenadayalan was able to understand the problems faced by the client on a daily basis. He got in touch with Justin to learn the requirements of the client and proceed with the solution. Justin and his team were unable to get a single point of ownership for all the issues. Also, problem management and coordination management were not executed properly. Deena told Justin that the involvement of a single partner would be the most feasible solution. He convinced the client to have TCS among all involved parties as to the single vendor for the infra management program.



With his rich infrastructure experience in working with multiple programs in consumer bank space, Deenadayalan was able to view the consumer application, process flows, and stakeholders involved easily. He also identified the gaps in the bank process and procedures and notified them to Justin. He partnered with the IS team of TCS and made use of their experience in infrastructure engagement to arrive at the solution. After a few weeks of intensive work, Deena came up with the proposed solution of one vendor management. He presented the solution to Justin and explained it. The solution streamlined the documents, was a single procedure, one point ownership, and proper accountability. Infrastructure management moved to a single vendor partnership that was established among the resources. This proved to be a good solution that pleased the client. Justin was impressed by the solution and hosted a party at the workplace. He invited Deenadayalan as the chief guest, and he was the center of attention at the party.

TCS ensured that the transition was seamless and did not have an impact on the existing delivery to the client. The client was impressed by the flawless execution and all the deliverables were completed on time.",A Solution That Streamlined The Workflow And Promoted Efficient Vendor Management,SHAROAN Mohammed,Retail Banking,Process optimization,Growth & Transformation,Item,1
"The client was a leading North American investment bank with a global presence. Michel, the operations manager of the client, was assigned an important task. He had to reduce some targets to optimize the operational costs associated with the business operations. He got in touch with the technology infrastructure team and requested them to identify applications to identify the opportunities to reduce the operational costs. However, the transaction detail processing application for statements identified that there were multiple database processes which consumed more costs for the application. The client realized that the operational costs increased with the increase in the size of the tables.

The client didn’t want to increase their operational costs due to the increase in the table size. They wanted to identify a feasible approach to reduce the costs in query optimization, without changing more code logic related to the application. Michel found it challenging in the application as a subset/part of data from the table as it was being sent to downstream servers for business processing. He was also in charge of customer management and had to handle requests from the technology operations team and satisfy the business requirements and send them to the downstream server. This got him worried as it had further increased the operational costs due to the consumption of storage MIPS.

Michel turned to Yuvaraj of TCS for a solution. With his deep contextual knowledge built over seven years of experience with the customer, Yuvaraj was the ideal option for this situation. Yuvaraj was aware of the different processes belonging to multiple applications of the customer and also had a good knowledge of the process flow. He also had a good understanding of the downstream servers for which the trade activities need to be sent. He had an exact understanding of the way the client functions and priorities.

Yuvaraj understood the business involved in the process and how to fine-tune the application with a more holistic approach. He understood that the data from this process was very critical for the downstream server and needed to ensure that the changes deployed did not affect the trade processing handled by the downstream server. Upon further research, he understood that the two query processes related to the database had to be merged into a single process.


Yuvaraj made a minor processing logic change to handle the selection criteria in the database end rather than the source code. This ensured that only the current day trade records of 200k were needed for downstream was extracted rather than extracting 91 million records on a daily basis. Yuvraj then applied the current day processing logic in source code.

With his contextual knowledge, he suggested that the redundant process which was used for backup references to handle business queries can be removed and only the recent trade activities were needed for down streams/business. Michel agreed to the solution and implemented it through proper testing in the UAT environment. He was impressed with Yuvaraj’s method as minimal code changes worked fine, and this saved around $150k for the customer yearly. The client was delighted with Yuvaraj’s implementation and praised him for his efforts.",A Change In The Operations That Saved Costs And Reduced Unwanted Processes,SHAROAN Mohammed,Investment Banking,OpEx,Cost & Optimization,Item,2
"The client was a leading bank with a global presence in NA, APAC and LATAM geographies. The operations of the client in the LATAM region was impacted due to the non-availability of local Process Quality Assurance (PQA) reviews to support the Project Management Office (PMO) group. Carlos was the manager for the PMO group in the LATAM region and they had to depend on the APAC PQA reviewers to support them for deliveries. The other challenges faced by Carlos and his team with APAC reviewers were the difficulty in communication, cultural differences, understanding the requirements and the difference in time zones.

For the multinational banking client with operations across the globe, it is utmost important to have a team of local PQA reviewers supporting the local PMO group. But the client’s operational structure had PQA reviewers for APAC and NA regions only. To market the products and provide customer support required effective review of the product deliverables and collaboration with the PQA team to resolve the issues. But without a local PQA team, the LATAM PMO group was facing a lot of operational issues as PQA was essential to control the risks associated with the deliverables.

The client had multiple vendors apart from TCS and hence it was important for TCS to find a solution quickly than its competitors. TCS appointed Hemavathi Sundaramoorthy as the Contextual Master (CM) for the engagement. Hemavathi had no option of failing since TCS would have the risk of losing the client to its competition. Hemavathi had the experience of working with the client in a PMO group leading a team of quality reviewers. Having worked with the client for years, Hemavathi gained in-depth knowledge on the quality review processes, knowledge on the client’s global culture especially LATAM and working with diverse teams.


Hemavathi’s first task was to have a series of discussions with the client to understand the issue better. She proposed for additional resources for the LATAM region but initially, it was refused by the client as they did not have approvals for increasing the headcount. This made Hemavathi rethink her solution. This led to more discussions with the client to identify ways to solve the issue with LATAM without increasing the headcount nor the client’s budget.

Hemavathi also had discussions with the TCS management to find out if local talent was available with the required skill set, operation cost involved in recruiting a local resource and ways to provide cost-benefit to the client. After gathering the required inputs from the TCS management, she convinced the client to reduce the headcount of the competitor and increase the same for TCS to operate from LATAM. TCS recruited its first local talent in 2018 to provide support for LATAM and by 2020 TCS had a 4-member local team supporting LATAM.

Hemavathi’s solution to setting a team of 4 PQA reviewers in the LATAM region helped in supporting their LATAM PMO group. Engagement of local talent in LATAM avoided the challenges that were faced earlier by the client like communication gap, cultural differences and time zone differences. The solution also reduced the oversight from PQA reviewers of NA region who were overloaded earlier. With the local PQA reviewers, collaboration with the PMO group increased with significant improvement in the process delivery of the LATAM region within the budget. With this engagement, TCS was able to increase the headcount in the LATAM region and also helped in leveraging the local talent by 100%.",Support To Latam Pmo Group Through Local Talent,SHARMILEE PRAKASH,Cards,Regulatory & Compliance,Cost & Optimization,Item,1

"The client was a multinational bank providing financial services across the globe. The client was practising the Waterfall methodology for its software development. As the industry was heading towards Agile methodology, it increased the automation footprint for faster feedback and lesser time to market. When more projects moved towards Agile practices, the Quality Assurance team realized that they were not sufficiently equipped. Cooper who was heading the QA team convened a strategic meeting to discuss the key challenges and to brainstorm ways to resolve them.

The first challenge was to develop test cases from day one of the Agile sprint when the application was not available. The second challenge was to involve the functional testing team in automation testing and eventually train them to be Quality Engineers (QE). The third challenge was practising the Behaviour Driven Development. Finally, the optimization of test suites and improving the productivity of the automation team posed a challenge.

The client, a global provider of financial services, was the client of TCS since 2005. As the industry started embracing more of Agile methodology, automation became the industry norm ensuring quicker feedback and lesser time to market. The client used manual testing for the Agile sprints and as more projects started adopting Agile methodology, all the testing phases became automated. But the client’s Quality Assurance team was not ready for the change and hence the client entrusted TCS to bring the transformation. The client called it an Automation Acceleration program which required TCS to train 300+ associates of the client with new tools and techniques. PM Suresh Kumar Ramasamy who had worked with the client for 10 years on various technologies was identified as the Contextual Master (CM). Suresh had a strong understanding of the client’s applications, processes and stakeholder’s needs.

Suresh Kumar started the journey with his strong automation team by analyzing the application architectures. He knew that simplifying the automation framework would motivate the functional testers to do automation testing. So, the team built a fusion of a model-based testing solution (CA Agile Requirements Designer) and the test automation process (eggPlant). The Model-Based testing tool was introduced to the testing team to create models of the application. Models were a visual flow chart representation of the application flow.

Once the models were created by testers, a set of predefined English like keywords can be used as input to user actions inside each component of the model. The keywords were automatically mapped to the actual functions using a configuration file. The testers were able to define the entire workflow with the keywords and by referring to the UI wireframes of the application. Another feature of the tool was that both manual and automation test scripts could be generated and exported. Once the application build was ready, the test scripts were executed by an automation testing tool which also supported OCR based object recognition. Since the tool had issues with object recognition, Suresh collaborated with TCS automation COE and created a new framework with the Behaviour Driven Development (BDD) flavour along with the existing tool.

The new framework implemented by Suresh’s team helped the client to easily adopt the Agile practices. The innovative approach in training the functional testing team resulted in a transformation of more than 70% of the team to Quality Engineers. The UFT tool allowed a systematic way of optimizing the test cases and helped to achieve 30% test suite optimization. With 50% more reusability, manual productivity for test cases increased 2x times and automation productivity increased by 3X times. The client immensely praised Suresh and his team for the dedication and hard work into building an innovative solution.",Successful Deployment Of Uft Automation Tool For Agile Practices,SHAROAN Mohammed,Cards,Test Automation,Growth & Transformation,Item,1
"The client was a popular banking and finance service provider. Jasmine, the operations manager of the bank, faced a crucial challenge. The delivery and shipment of the expected credit card requests were very challenging. She had to process these requests immediately and attend to customers on time. However, she noticed that the bank faced many issues due to the number of cycles running daily to process these requests. Also, they depended on an external vendor to print the plastics which would cost the bank in case of any SLA breach. Jasmine also received complaints from some customers they received duplicate cards. She had to resort to a solution given the severity of the issue.

Jasmine analyzed the situation further and understood that the processing of the entire expedited request was done across five cycles in a day. She found that each cycle cost the bank an amount with respect to the volume. There was also an additional source of complexity due to the interdependency across different teams. This processing also had a vendor dependency and any miss in SLA would cost the bank. The pressing issue here was if any card request was missed, the client had to pay a refund and deliver the card for free, which would result in revenue loss.

Jasmine turned to TCS and explained the gravity of the situation to them. The TCS team proposed to reduce the number of cycles based on the mailing schedule plan at the vendor end. This included the reduction of validation, monitoring required for each cycle. However, the system complexity as the expedited card process used the same core logic as that of the regular card request. Dealing with this was a challenge as TCS had to work with the client, vendor and other interlinked teams. Anand, a project coordinator of TCS, stepped in.

Anand’s expertise in the subsystem, banking domain knowledge and experience with the team for many years helped him to propose better solutions. He had a very good rapport with Jasmine and gathered the required information from her. He did a proper groundwork starting with collecting the daily volume of request, timings, different channels through which the request came. Anand also interacted with the vendor related to the volume of requests they were able to process. He checked whether the system capability was able to handle a larger volume per cycle. He identified sources of duplicates and checked the behaviour of each card request.

Anand also understood the daily traffic, learnt the interdependency with the vendor. These aspects helped Anand draft a solution with minimum changes in the most cost-effective manner. He was also a point of contact for production support and hence knew the criticality of this issue. He also came up with a solution that eliminated duplicate requests being sent to the customers, which was another cost-effective solution. Anand and the TCS team ensured that all the existing functionalities worked without issues and proper regression was taken care. Jasmine was happy to see that the number of cycles reduced to three, which would reduce the chances for SLA miss. All requests were processed without any delay. The client was happy with Anand’s solution and appreciated him.",A Solution That Enabled Timely Processing Of Requests,SHAROAN Mohammed,Cards,OpEx,Cost & Optimization,Item,3
"The client was a popular multinational bank that faced issues with their servers that impacted their business. Nancy, the system administrator of the bank, got to the forefront to address the issue. She noticed that the client had to wait until the customer cardholder had full information or data until two sets of batch jobs got complete. The first set was for CCF CDB (Customer Database Built) files and the second one is CU (Contact Utility) standard layout files. If any one of the jobs fails from two sets of production batch jobs in UNIX, then the complete CDB daily Built file and CUDB update needs to be in the waiting state.

In a meeting with the technical lead of the bank, Nancy was informed that each day two sets of production batch jobs must be completed on time. If any server issue occurred from the UNIX side, it would impact the CDB daily Built file, CUDB update and other updates will be delayed. The systems/applications use the CUDB and CDB files for their process and will be using only the previous day data and not the current day data. Nancy turned to TCS for a solution. TCS stepped forward and appointed Rajesh Miriyala for the task. Rajesh was well versed with the CDB, CU, UNIX operating environment, and the client’s work environment.

Rajesh played a developer role and identified the problem after discussing it with Nancy and the technical lead. He gathered all the required information to analyze the problem. He increased the record length in one set of jobs to accommodate all missed CDB fields into CU STRD layout and reduced 70 jobs to 35 jobs. This saved the server time and transmission time by giving one common feed to both CDB and CU. The change affected two teams upstream and downstream. The idea was to combine two sets of production batches into one by combining CDB layout to the CU STRD layout. CU STRD already had 95% of data similar to CDB and hence the combined layout idea was successful.






By reducing the number of jobs, Mainframe and UNIX server load reduced and saved a lot of server space. One job would occupy 30 GB space from each server. After reducing all 70 jobs to 35 jobs, around 1000 GB was saved and the server efficient run time also increased.

Business used a CDB set of data for the customer database built and CU data was used for updating the CU database with the respective customer information. This combined both CDB and CU required data into one program and increased the file length to an extent. Rajesh’s update reflected in two servers Mainframe and UNIX. By implementing his idea, both server spaces were released and the server run time had increased. Rajesh also checked with the business regarding the importance of account information, phone number/non-contact information updates.

Nancy was impressed by Rajesh’s approach and analysis of the problem in terms of job running time and server utilization. She was happy with the reduced consumption of server space and run time. TCS had fulfilled the agreement in abends reduction from 90% to 99%.

"The client was one of the largest banks in North America. Richard, the chief system administrator of the client, was in-charge of a compliance project. This project involved having to purge customer data from the archived note system based on an account number. It involved redesigning the existing architecture to achieve the requirement. The project included the sunset of the current architecture and migration of the data to the new architecture.

Richard knew that this would ensure a complete redesign of the existing functionalities and meet the objectives set by the client. However, he had to act quickly as the short timeline of the project required efficient planning of migration with various teams involved in building the new architecture. Richard was worried as the existing internal architecture created roadblocks for enhancements and new project requirements. This increased the complexity of the operation. He knew that no one in his team was technically equipped to address this situation, so he turned to TCS for a solution. The client handed over this project to TCS and wanted them to deliver it within the timeline.

With over nine years of working knowledge in the bank’s US platform, Shaldrin Pereira of TCS, an SME in various subsystems stepped forward. Shaldrin was an expert in the subsystem and had a strong knowledge of the bank’s operations. He suggested a new architectural approach by analyzing the current system and identifying the difficulties of achieving the compliance objective. He also worked with the required teams to smoothly deliver the project within the short timeline and migrated all the data into a new architecture. Shaldrin and his team also made sure that the existing functionalities worked smoothly and the system was open for new enhancements that would improve customer interaction.



Shaldrin’s proposed new architectural changes needed to achieve the compliance object of the project requirement. He explained the detailed design of the migration and the steps involved in migrating the data into the new architecture and the changes needed to complete the project. Shaldrin and the TCS team worked on making sure that all the existing functionalities worked without issues and the migration was done smoothly within the timeline to meet the compliance objective. Most of the large subsystems that were based on an old existing architecture required client oversight, however, this migration was completely managed by TCS right from design to implementation.

Richard was happy as the hard work put forward by Shaldrin and his team for over five months helped the bank to successfully migrate to the new architecture. It also completed the compliance objective of the project within the timeline. The migration also helped in additional enhancements to the subsystem, thereby helping in improving the flow of the subsystem and the end-user experience. The client appreciated Shaldrin for his architectural changes and his functional and contextual knowledge in the platform.

"The client`s Commercial Lending Operations was buzzing with activities on a busy Monday morning .All of them glued to their systems, opening word documents and excel. The team followed word document/excel to track the user reported queries for their BAU activities. But, was this fruitful is the major question in everyone's mind. Yes, to be honest, it was a timing consuming and painful process. But, what can be done?

The client was a leading financial institution with an array of customer-centric services. They preferred to convert it to Systematic tracking, which was an efficient and less error borne tracking method. On an average, the Operations team gets around 30 tickets per month and they spend around 2 to 3 hours to keep records of each ticket. Therefore, they were desperately looking for Systematic tracking with no new additional tool costs to be involved. The Operations team of TCS approached Application System Analyst for the possible solutions. Since it involved technical concepts, the System analyst decided to have a discussion with the technology team and their search ended with Saravanan Selvavinayagam.



He was part of the Technology team which supported the application which was needed. System analyst explained the requirement to him. For the technology team, this was a new concept and doing conversion with minimal effort from the Operation team which should be cost effective was a challenge for his team. In addition, this conversion should also support emergency id release for the production support, through Web Automation Information Services (WAIS portal supported by the client). Therefore, he decided to look for an existing tool supported by the client.

After tremendous analysis, a decision was made to use the Service Now application, which supported systematic tracking as well as WAIS emerid release for the production support. Saravanan coordinated with the ServiceNow team and got the necessary details to automate this process. Surprisingly the only detail required from the Operation team was their email DL that was required for this Systematic tracking. This DL was now configured in the ServiceNow Incident database.

The next challenge was to support the emerid release in WAIS portal since this portal supported only a few originating groups of the incident. He then coordinated with the WAIS support team to add Operation team group name as one of the emerid approver list. After making this change, ServiceNow DL changes moved to the production environment. Whenever a user faced a problem, they would send an email to a DL which would be configured in ServiceNow. This opened an incident, with email subject as incident title, email content as description and requestor name from email FROM address and assigned it to the Operations team. If it was required to make changes in the production environment, an incident ticket assigned to system analyst, who in turn would release his emerid using the WAIS portal would complete this change. After which, the ticket would be assigned back to the Operations team, who in turn would confirm with the user.

If the user is convinced with the changes, he will accept the resolution and close the incident. All communications/tasks were tracked systematically and an alert was triggered for each comment change. This saved around 15-60 minutes per ticket.
The client was very happy with TCs and said that the new system was going to work really well and will start saving time. After all the hard work, when Saravanan and his team heard these comments from the Operations team thought their target was achieved.
Thanks to Saravanan and his expert team that the same automation was now incorporated in all Commercial Lending and Deposits applications to enable emerid for the technology team for providing BAU support, based on approval from the client’s Resource Manager.",Automation For Systematic Tracking,SHAROAN Mohammed,Commercial Banking,Automation,Cost & Optimization,Item,1
"The digital era of today has made our lives so easier. From online shopping to banking activities – we consumers, today, can get everything done by just spending a couple of minutes on our phone. And while it has made our lives so much easier, it has also put an extra burden on the companies in the form of monetary compensation. Today, to stay updated with the latest technology and provide smooth services to consumers, companies have to shell out much more than what they used to do earlier.

And one such company was a leading bank with a presence in 17 markets across the world. The finance team of the bank realized that the “SMS facility” option was posing a very high cost to the bank and it was time to cut down the costs. So, in a quick meeting, Daryl, the IT head was tasked with the responsibility to come up with a system that could help reduce the cost without affecting business as usual.

After analyzing the situation, Daryl thought it was best to hire an experienced third-party vendor with enough experience in mobile architecture and technology. And he immediately set out to find the right vendor. Several interviews and countless brainstorming sessions later, Daryl finalized TCS, a consultancy with which the bank shared a very old bond. TCS was more than glad to assist and assigned the project to one of its most talented employees in this segment – Mohana Chelvi Rangaramanujam.

Mohona had 4+ years of experience in mobile architecture and mobile-based technologies but what made her the perfect fit for the project lead role was her experience with both the bank’s digital and legacy systems. She had a fair idea on the bank’s Business and Technical challenges, which helped her to come up with the solution – Push Notification technology. Mohana did an exhaustive analysis of the existing challenges to come up with a detailed recommendation on the approach of replacing SMS OTP with a custom universal authenticator solution leveraging mobile’s Push Notification technology.

It would cut down the SMS cost and provide seamless customer experience of authenticating high-risk transactions. She implemented the same solution for IVR based authentication of high-risk transactions too.

"The digital era of today has made our lives so easier. From online shopping to banking activities – we consumers, today, can get everything done by just spending a couple of minutes on our phone. And while it has made our lives so much easier, it has also put an extra burden on the companies in the form of monetary compensation. Today, to stay updated with the latest technology and provide smooth services to consumers, companies have to shell out much more than what they used to do earlier.

And one such company was a leading bank with a presence in 17 markets across the world. The finance team of the bank realized that the “SMS facility” option was posing a very high cost to the bank and it was time to cut down the costs. So, in a quick meeting, Daryl, the IT head was tasked with the responsibility to come up with a system that could help reduce the cost without affecting business as usual.

After analyzing the situation, Daryl thought it was best to hire an experienced third-party vendor with enough experience in mobile architecture and technology. And he immediately set out to find the right vendor. Several interviews and countless brainstorming sessions later, Daryl finalized TCS, a consultancy with which the bank shared a very old bond. TCS was more than glad to assist and assigned the project to one of its most talented employees in this segment – Mohana Chelvi Rangaramanujam.

Mohona had 4+ years of experience in mobile architecture and mobile-based technologies but what made her the perfect fit for the project lead role was her experience with both the bank’s digital and legacy systems. She had a fair idea on the bank’s Business and Technical challenges, which helped her to come up with the solution – Push Notification technology. Mohana did an exhaustive analysis of the existing challenges to come up with a detailed recommendation on the approach of replacing SMS OTP with a custom universal authenticator solution leveraging mobile’s Push Notification technology.

It would cut down the SMS cost and provide seamless customer experience of authenticating high-risk transactions.

"The finance industry experiences around 1/5th of all cyber-attacks and incidents, making it the most targeted industry in the world. The Personal Identifiable Information (PII) and financial data that organizations in the banking and financial sector hold make them obvious targets to cyber-attacks. Remediating all vulnerable technologies stands out as a priority for these organizations as cybercriminals monetize information quickly, either by selling it on the dark web or transferring funds from hacked accounts into their own.

Paul Fraser, the Chief of Operations at FinCorp, a multinational banking and financial organization, noticed that having many such vulnerable technologies was something that needed to be addressed as quickly as possible. FinCorp’s applications and web-services were deployed in 9 APAC countries and 5 EMEA countries. FinCorp’s underlying framework facilitated different applications with more than 250 screens and over 100 web-services, that had to be transformed and deployed in over 15 countries.

Paul realized that remediation was required for core client and server technologies, which was a huge task as small changes at framework level required a thorough execution across all screens deployed around the globe. The upper management was not ready to take the risk with so many applications being on a single framework platform, potentially impacting the business of millions of customers.

TCS was already playing a major role in FinCorp’s customer management segment. Paul approached TCS for their assistance and trusted them to come up with a robust and well-executed solution that would not compromise the business of FinCorp’s customers. Agarwal Ambul, who was a part of the client’s framework from its inception, and her team were ready to accept the challenge and eager to re-engineer the framework to meet quality and security standards. During her seven-year stint with the client, Ambul had gained an in-depth understanding of the client’s business and its processes. Ambul was also cognizant of the challenges around system availability and trading data availability that the client was grappling within lower environments.

Understanding the criticality of the system and the client’s position in the market, Ambul came up with the idea of degradation-up-gradation of the entire framework. Her proposal would enable all deployed applications to switch to the latest non-vulnerable technologies. Ambul, along with her team, created tweaks on the framework dashboard that provided an in-built rollback facility to applications at run-time, capable of handling sudden surges during the time of deployment. Paul and the client were extremely satisfied with Ambul’s implementation, earning the trust of the upper management as well.

The upgraded framework dashboard was swiftly rolled out to different markets, with Paul delighted to note that Ambul’s implementation enhanced system availability, improved upon issue detection and remediated vulnerability across all regions. The client was happy to announce that vulnerable incidents dropped by 15%, enabling seamless trading operations. Ambul’s transformation journey with the client showcased her talents as a contextual master and gave confidence to the client about going forward in the market without having to worry about security breaches or vulnerabilities. Her efforts aligned with the client’s aim of providing cyber-resilience and protection to customer’s data and money.

Ambul proved to be a key factor in ensuring their trust and belief in TCS’ ability to understand their business problems and translate them into transformation proposals and foresee vulnerabilities, bringing more business for TCS in the competitive market space.",Remediating Framework Dashboard For Resisting Cyberattacks,AMIT KUMAR SONI,Retail Banking,Technology Infrastructure,Growth & Transformation,Item,1
"The integration of Salesforce enables banks to quickly identify the needs and requirements of its customers and to exploit the available opportunities. Only then can a bank build profitable, long-term customer relationships where the customers have all the convenience of remote banking and at the same time receive a high degree of personal service. By building on a customers’ contact/service history, such an integrated Salesforce system would ensure that they are always treated in the correct manner, regardless of the interaction point; branch, call center or the Internet, and that the full details of each interaction are always captured. Patrick, the CEO of an American multinational investment bank and financial services corporation, wanted TCS to work as a partner for leveraging their Salesforce for the servicing customers. The Company had 8000+ users. The Group’s US Retail Information Technology Division provided Technology services and support for the Global Consumer-NA.

Working in partnership with functional leaders creates a sustainable, profitable growth by leveraging Technology. The key features in the project were: Customer 360- providing a better view of the Client’s relationship across the accounts, profiles, packages, and CINs and enabling the launch of servicing directly off the Customer 360 View, Real-Time Card, Balance and PIN Information - to create the ability to pull real-time customer data such as demographics, FATCA, Card and PIN data using APIs, Offer Management- allowing the disposition of offers to occur directly from the Salesforce while remaining in sync with the existing COP functionality, Mortgage Referrals- integrating systematically between the Retail & Mortgage Salesforce instances and CTI & Softphone - building a Softphone in the Salesforce integrated with the CTI adapter.


TCS had a large pool of experienced senior Salesforce consultants, banking domain experts, business analysts and vendor certified consultants. Out of them, Veera Prasad, with in-depth knowledge of CRM and the best practices, was chosen to take up this project. TCS has a dedicated Salesforce practice. It uses the Technology Maturity Model to measure and improve practice maturity. Prasad had been working as a ‘Technical Architect’ for the Group and was working closely with the Business partners, Relationship Managers, Financial Advisors, and Bankers on gathering the Salesforce requirements. He observed that the users had to follow standard procedures and best practices while servicing the customers. They had to go through an external system or rely on colleagues to get the step by step procedure or information about the different products in order to serve the clients.

With his contextual knowledge, Prasad utilized the Best Practices for the Banking Enterprise. He integrated, analyzed, and refined the data. Firstly, he collected and consolidated the customer-related data from the customer touch-points, current accounts, non-account internal information, and the external data sources. The Customers’ demands for security and privacy were increasing. Therefore, it was essential to develop an authentication mechanism that provided security and password protection. Developing a consumer household view rather than an account view was important, but consumer privacy demanded that the Salesforce system enable household constituents to “opt-out” and not receive solicitations that other members may choose to subscribe to or “opt-in.” Thus, Prasad developed the right contact strategy by knowing which offers and incentives to offer to which customers and when.",Creating A Sustainable And Profitable Growth Strategy By Leveraging Technology,AMIT KUMAR SONI,Retail Banking,OpEx,Cost & Optimization,Item,1
"The management of a leading US-based auto finance company had decided unanimously to create a new accounting system for calculating the earnings of its insurance business. Based on this decision, Viktor*, its CFO came up with a broad accounting idea that included the creation of an operational data store, implementation of core business logic for earning calculation along with accounting, and financial reporting in the business intelligence system. TCS was roped in to help with the implementation of this system and Tridib was assigned to it as he had both the contextual knowledge of customer’s insurance business as well as the expertise of working as a QA solution architect for the account.

At the outset, he knew that the client had a legacy accounting system with complex accounting rules and little to no documentation to explain them. Moreover, these cases covered only 60% as the rest were seen as exceptional cases with varying business scenarios and product types. Overall, it was a challenging project given the many discrepancies in the prevailing accounting system, and there was always a potential for missing the deadlines.

Using this thorough understanding of the client's systems and processes, Tridib conceptualized and architected a quality assurance strategy that helped in system build-up through reverse engineering. A parallel testing strategy was devised to compare the earning calculations between the legacy application and the new system, but the challenge was with the data validation between the existing and the new systems due to additional data attributes in the new system, a change in calculation logic for some of the common data attributes, very high data volume (>10 millions), heterogeneous technological platforms for the existing and new systems, and involvement of long-running batch processes.

his data comparison required an automated validation approach that could efficiently perform data comparison and find out only the valid discrepancies. Test automation solution using traditional QA tools available with the customer could not meet the expectation due to high data volume & complexity of data comparison. Tridib had helped to design an automated validation process leveraging mainframe technologies (like JCL, COBOL) for creating a landing zone for source and target, data formatting and standardization, and comparison which proved to be very efficient. Apart from that, his contextual knowledge was instrumental in automated failure analysis and identification of unique business scenarios from a large number of mismatches in parallel testing.

Ultimately the failure analysis worked as effective input for the new system to discover the missing core business logic and to build a system that met the customer's expectations. The customer was very happy to launch the project on time since it was indeed a big achievement given the complexity, timeline, and challenges around the project. This successful implementation opened up newer opportunities for TCS. The very next initiative (which was related to compliance work - IFRS implementation, project value $1.43 Million) under the same national manager, was awarded to TCS through an RFP.

"The mobile/cell phone has taken over a large part of our lives. The current generation cannot think of spending even a day without using a mobile phone. Grasping this reality many sectors of business started taking their business to the mobile world in the hope of earning more customers and it worked! The banking sector was one such sector and today, several banks have their mobile apps.
A leading bank with a presence in over 17 markets across the APAC & EMEA region was no different. It wanted to adopt a “mobile-first” strategy to reach out to most customers, but unfortunately, its current platform was not up to the mark. Karen, the IT head was leading the mobile-first strategy and she was extremely disappointed to find performance issues in the system. This was a hindrance to the mobile-first strategy and she needed an effective solution to get back on track.

Karen spoke to several external partners in the hope of finding the right partner to work with to develop a strategy. When the search bore no fruit, Karen decided to hand over the project to TCS, one of the oldest external vendors of the bank. Given the age-old relationship, TCS was aware that the client’s mobile platform lagged several generations behind and that the mobile app was unable to cope-up with the external digital revolution and the internal digital transformation. The TCS team agreed to help its old pal and handed over the project to the one who they thought could help in the best possible way – Senthil Kumar B.

Senthil had 6+ years of experience in the API based transformation programs but what made him the perfect fit for the project lead role was his experience with both the bank’s digital and legacy systems. He had a fair idea of the bank’s Business and Technical challenges, which helped him to come up with an effective solution. Senthil did an exhaustive analysis of the existing challenges to come up with a detailed recommendation on the approach for the transformation of the bank’s mobile application. He also made recommendations for various solutions, the architecture of the mobile application, and analysis of tools like Crashlytics, Performance Monitoring, etc.

The newly transformed mobile application developed by Senthil improved digital penetration among digital native customers. Karen was happy to see an improved app rating at the Google App and Apple App stores and a significant increase in the Net Promoter Score (NPS) too. Happy with the successful digital transformation, Karen decided to launch a ""complete digital bank experience"" for high value and privileged customers and handed over the project to the TCS team.

"The thing about regulatory compliance is that it needs to be updated regularly. Sam was always watchful about how his company watched out for the changes in the regulations. He worked in one of the biggest banks in North America. Sam was part of the team of the 200-year-old bank that worked tirelessly to provide consumers, corporations, governments, and institutions with a broad range of financial services and products. The bigger the bank, the higher the risk management role is to deal with potential losses protecting the value of its assets.

Even though the bank had excellent risk management, some of the regulatory compliances under the customer service operations were unattended over a year. This created a risk in Legal, Regulatory, Compliance, Anti-Money Laundering (AML), Records Management sectors. The credit and debit match up were not appropriately handled, resulting in disputes. There were no proper reports to analyze and handle disputes. The match-up reports were needed to check the APR (Annual Percentage Rate) to calculate interest rate against Credit and Debit transactions. If the situation was not handled properly, it would result in poor quality data on customer service operations. So, the client proposed to handle this scenario in a timely and quality manner. Also, they aimed to create many match-up reports to track financial transactions and APR values. TCS appointed CM to create a solution.

Balakrishnan, TCS Mainframe Technical Lead with 10+ years of experience, had a long-standing association with the client. He had worked in multiple applications like TRIAD, Recovery, Hp Exstream, CBNA, Afore, and Account Receivables. He had acquired extensive contextual knowledge of Mainframe and BFS (Banking & Financial) domains, by working closely with the business team in different geographic locations.

As per the client’s defined process, Balakrishnan and his team addressed all the requirements promptly. Continuous changes in the client's needs proved to be a hurdle, but he managed to tackle them well. Balakrishnan introduced key advancements in the report creation process. He then spelled out a well-defined process flow to set up the daily report creation. By automating the mail sending process, he ensured that they could send the match-up reports to the business team daily. He ensured detailed reporting for disputes unattended over the year as part of the remediation process. He then captured all possible business criteria to make a high-quality report that included validation on credit and debit transactions. Balakrishnan deployed and stabilized the high-quality report creation process in a short period.

Balakrishnan’s impeccable reports helped the client understand their processes at the transactional and dispute resolution processes. It helped them identify the customer service operation related to regulatory compliance. The client was pleased and appreciative of Balakrishnan and his team’s efforts on handling the immediate changes and on-time deployment.

"The usage of the internet has progressed rapidly with time leaving a need for security. There was a heightened need to provide support towards tracking Critical GEM across the globe. GEM (Global Event Management) was an enterprise-wide application that had critical vulnerability findings report made by the security team. This posed a direct threat to the business of the client and would prove to be highly sensitive.

There was no centralized Governance available to ensure that critical vulnerability remediations were being efficiently planned, coordinated and closed in a timely manner. This had the highest visibility with Senior leadership considering the criticality of vulnerability remediation across the globe. Justin Smith, the Operations Manager noticed that there was a lack of a consolidated view that teams could act upon. Each region was using disparate data reports resulting in silos and lack of a holistic organizational view of the findings.

GEM remediation tracking execution and Governance was manual and resource-intensive as a significant amount of effort was spent on building supportive dashboards after manual cleansing, analyzing various data streams. Keeping all this in mind, TCS was approached to provide a solution.

Sreelalitha Boddapaty assigned as Senior Project Manager. Initially, Justin did not completely f trust on the external team to deliver a global solution; so it was a twofold balancing act for Sreelalitha, to establish governance that took systemic constraints and also allow to pursue a future sustainable model to win the customer trust. This was overcome by leveraging the excellent maturity of TCS infrastructure and production support SME that were the keys to this engagement success.



This engagement needed extensive collaboration and planning efforts with various support groups across the globe. Sreelalitha strategically positioned the team of project managers as per time zone and geographical needs (ex: Spanish resources to effectively communicate in Mexico region). This resulted in a % completion increase from 30% in April to 93% in Dec 2019. Sustained progress in tracking and planning was also achieved along with the continuous adding of a book of work.

She helped achieve the following: Streamlined and collaborative GEMS remediation process along with monthly prioritization forums, simplified daily manual reporting through automation options, established daily planning workshops with individual stakeholders for quicker and timely issue resolution in remediation closures and maintained snapshots of each individual component across all regions by domain and by accountability to ensure better tracking of remediations.

A key win for this critical engagement was the well-simplified dashboard, conceptualized and published by the team which was being considered as “mother of truth” for all CIOs. GEMS was added onto JIRA which would automate the execution process and add accountability thereby expanding the client’s horizons.

Sreelalitha and her team achieved the tasks assigned in a short time of 9 months and supervised the team from conceptualization to solution. The customer team and the interfacing stakeholders were extremely appreciative of the good work done by the team. The year-end report card published by the client was a testimony for another TCS success.",Improving The Gem Application,"Krishnamani, Mr. Vijay (Vijay Krishnamani)",Cards,Process optimization,Growth & Transformation,Item,1
"The vacation plan of Alissa Mayer*, senior director of treasury operations of a mid-size financial company, was stalled as she faced a challenging task of creating a new ecosystem for Collateral Management. They had shifted their Collateral Management operations to a new vendor in 2019. “There was no room for complacency with the earlier vendor”, Alissa recollected. “They could not provide a flexible solution that benefitted the end users”, she was perplexed. “Their solution did not facilitate portfolio addition and reconciliation and had a stale pricing update, and pricing hierarchy, albeit partnering for 10 years.” Moreover, the pricing hierarchy model was externally controlled by them, which led to increased cost and major dependency on them. Alissa observed that the current vendor was economically more viable and hoped that this change would give them better control on the solution approach and customer data.

"To execute his diversification strategy, Adolf, the CEO of a leading Life Insurance financial services company based out of the US purchased a closed block of Life Insurance business from another leading Life Insurance Company in 2014. However, as part of this acquisition, they had many IT challenges concerning the Infrastructure and Operation readiness, External billing integration/Feeds, Customer correspondence with Protective paper and Consolidation, Policy Administration System Consolidation, and SOX and Audit requirements.

TCS was a part of the application development and maintenance support for the closed block of the Life Insurance business. It was a part of the client's acquisition journey and helped them to overcome all these IT challenges. It proposed a managed service model for the closed book of systems. There were a total of 26 legacy applications spanned across from Policy Services, billing, Correspondences, and Death benefits.

Rubini Lloyd, the technical Lead as placed by TCS, was a member of this managed services team. She took many initiatives to resolve the infrastructure operational readiness issues around batch jobs, integrations with external systems, and correspondences with a new carrier paper. Many enhancements had to be delivered in a short period for the end customers (Policy Holders). Today the systems are very stable and already many systems have been migrated to the new platform. TCS was able to provide the service with minimal onsite presence reducing the IT costs and TCOI (Total Cost of Ownership) for the client.

With the successful delivery related to the optimization/migration work, the client gained confidence in TCS/Rubini. This helped TCS to get involved in the Policy Administration System (PAS) consolidation. The existing closed block of business had 6 PAS systems that needed to be consolidated into the two other custom-built PAS systems.

Rubini Lloyd was the SME for these systems for the last 8 years hence they awarded the conversion work to be completely delivered from offshore. Rubini was leading this initiative and created many automated conversion utilities and jobs that helped the client to pull policy Records, Coverages, Limits, Deductibles, Policy Extensions, Endorsements, etc. from the legacy IMSVSAM based systems. The conversion activity was getting completed successfully by October 2014.

Rubini was playing the technical/project lead role from offshore and delivering the conversion project 100% from offshore. TCS also understood the pain points to the Correspondence systems and proposed to migrate the existing CDMS based correspondence to the HP Exstream Dialogue inhouse solution and won the project in a fixed price bid. Again Rubini was the technical lead in the project and leading the delivery from offshore. TCS was doing this project in an agile mode with two weeks of sprints and weekly showcases. This project’s win was all because of the seamless integration and confidence that TCS delivered over 6 years.

The conversion program required someone who had a deep understanding of the legacy systems and also business knowledge. Rubini had been working on these systems for the last 9 years and hence possessed the complete functional/technical knowledge of all these 26 systems and how they were integrated. Moreover, the systems where the policy records had to be migrated were all file / IMS based and the routines were in Assembler. Rubini had also traveled to the client’s location and was working there for a year.

The seamless delivery and quick turnaround helped TCS to win the correspondence migration project (CDMS to HP Extreme dialogue). The higher level of automation, along with the modernization approach helped TCS to speed up the delivery process and achieve the desired results. The client appreciated Rubini Lloyd and her team for the efforts and thanked TCS for their partnership in all these initiatives.",Overcoming The Challenges In The Acquisition Journey,Hariharaprasad Iyer,Insurance,Technology Infrastructure,Cost & Optimization,Item,1
"Today, the digital era is evolving into an intelligence era. So, many banks are empowering their employees with information and automation. That's why, Sam, the CTO of a leading bank in North America, had embarked on the journey of becoming digital. Everything was going as per plan. But, as we know, nothing is permanent. Sam's team raised their concerns about the back end applications, such as Automated Credit Cards Collections Systems. This is because the bank still used legacy systems such as IBM Mainframe.

Earlier, the online calls to mainframe systems were processed by the CICS and Function vector table with the help of a middleware application. Although over the years the process had been fine-tuned and was able to handle thousands of calls to the backend system effectively. However, it created a dependency on the mainframe team. They required help from the Middleware team to create or update any service. Therefore, while introducing any new calls to the backend collections application, the mainframe team had to plan and collaborate among multiple teams. Overall, it took more time to implement any new change.

Sam knew that the above issue directly impacted his dream of going digital. Understanding the gravity of the situation, he asked TCS, their existing IT vendor, to help him with the problem. The TCS team started looking at different options to streamline the process and become more agile. While doing so, they roped in Anupam Chatterjee as a contextual master to drive the project. This is because he had previously worked with the client and had gained in-depth knowledge of their business and IT landscape. Besides, he had a good understanding of their working culture and challenges. With the help of this acquired contextual knowledge, Anupam was able to find a quick fix to the problem.


At the start, Anupam created a proof of concept by using CICS and IBM Z/OS connect services to create new microservices. As part of the POC, he created a simple microservice to make a call to the backend system and retrieve data in JSON format. The POC was successful, and the team was able to retrieve, and update data with the help of Z/OS connect services. During the same time, Sam wanted to offer collection capabilities via its digital channels, in which the customers would be able to select a payment plan and set up monthly payments as per the offer eligibility. This was Anupam's opportunity to roll out the POC to create and install new microservices in production. With the successful implementation, it invoked the online systems without any middleware dependency.

Post-implementation, the client was happy with the solution because it opened new doors for the Collections application. Further, it redefined its digital image service that was provided to their customers. Also, the solution created a platform for many other digital initiatives and increased operational performance.

"Uday the Technical Lead was working for a multinational bank spread across the world and operated a 24x7 customer service division in all regions. The US retail banking applications were operating on physical servers with WebSphere portlet factory dependencies. The WebSphere physical servers were compliant and developed performance issues whenever there was an increase in the no. of users. All the 5000 users were unable to log in at the same time as the server response time increased to more than 5secs from the portlet factory dependent servers.

During Oct-2019, all the physical servers of the US Retail applications warranted migration to cloud servers due to compliance issues. The US retail framework was coupled with Redhat 5 Linux WebSphere portlet factory jars of the IBM server. The cost of maintenance and the dependency of the Websphere portlet hampered the migration to cloud servers. The US retail applications had to be moved to cloud servers within the stipulated timeline, beyond which IBM would not be able to extend its support affecting the business users of the customer service division across all regions.


TCS was in charge of the development and support of the US retail applications. TCS held the responsibility to remove the IBM portlet factory dependencies and migrate to cloud RHEL 7 servers as a solution. To implement the same, decoupling all the US retail applications from the IBM portlet factory jar dependencies and rewrite on web-oriented architecture to accommodate the user requests on Http was planned. Change in the complete architecture of the framework layer before decoupling the dependencies was required for a smooth migration.

Vijay Durairaj from TCS possessed the contextual knowledge of decoupling the IBM jar dependencies using the spring web object architecture framework. He also held the credit for writing the architectural design and developing the code for migration of applications to next-gen tech stack and deploying them into cloud servers. Uday approached Vijay, the Technical Team Lead for a solution as the compliance dates were too close. Vijay analyzed the existing behavior of the systems and how the IBM dependencies were tagged to individual applications.

He faced issues during JSON conversion in the cloud server while using Jackson. The axis2 references were also failing during runtime in RHEL7 while operating the migrated application in the cloud server. To deal with the issues, Vijay created a framework reference with all Jackson property-related jars during runtime and to activate the SOAP services to interact with the downstream applications.

Uday was impressed with Vijay’s design which minimized the development effort by 75%. On Uday’s request, Vijay also created a framework to switch between physical and cloud servers based on the no. of users, which was appreciated by one and all. Vijay was presented with momentum as a token of appreciation for the solution delivered within the compliance date.

"Vinci, the head of the check processing division of one of the leading global financial institutions, was beginning to realize that customized products for applications from heavyweight vendors -- IBM, NCR and VSOFT -- were becoming an albatross around his neck. The vendors would take their own sweet time to implement any changes, and then also charge the corporation exorbitant sums for the same. be a more expensive for them. This is the problem Citi is facing, and wanted to avoid going to vendors where possible.

He felt trapped and helpless, and poured his heart out to Amit Yeri, a TCS associate and project manager in the same division. Always keeping the client’s interest first, Amit began working on ideas and building prototypes where compliance requirements, smaller business enhancements, and COB requirements could be managed without approaching the vendor. Vinci was won over not just by Amit’s helpful nature, proactive attitude and novel thought process, but also by his deep contextual knowledge.

With the client’s confidence built, it came as no surprise to Amit that he was called in when the client’s compliance team had to meet audit requirements to get the user list with the access roles and all the entitlement privileges along with user activity on a daily basis for all the applications from vendor VSOFT. Leveraging his contextual knowledge Amit and his team built a generic windows service component using Dot Net technology to generate and extract the user list on a daily basis. It met all the requirements of the client, and saved them the $120,000 VSOFT would have charged.

Similarly, when the client, for continuity of business, expected all data files generated by VSOFT products on the live production server to be in sync with the COB, VSOFT replied that they would charge for it, since it would be considered a future enhancement. The other option the client mulled was Arch, which would cost $5,000 per License per live and COB server. Its renewal charges were $1,000 annually.

Amit built a Byte-level file software that would replicate data files on runtime basis and consume minimum system resources. This generic service could be deployed on to 3 different vendor product live servers, saving software cost of around $30,000 annually, and renewal charges of $6,000 Similarly, when the client was looking for segregation of the non-negotiable items along with credit items from the Postable item queue, the NCR product’s existing module ACH file Export did not cut it. The vendor said they would charge $80,000 for the change needed, and take 3 months to implement them.

Amit proposed make changes in other modules like XMapper and Export to File, which NCR was not focusing on, and accomplish the
task. It was, needless to say a success, achieved in a month, that saved the client $80,000. Thanks to Amit, TCS has been getting a lot more business and grown to be the go-to vendor. The client sent Amit and his team appreciation certificates, while TCS gave his team the Star Team award.",It Solutions For Management Of Customized Applications,SHAROAN Mohammed,Retail Banking,Process optimization,Cost & Optimization,Item,1
"We all know that not all days are good days. There are days when nothing goes right and then there are days which only bring good news our way. But for Alex, the CTO of a leading US bank, a cold December morning was all sorts of bad. From the moment he stepped in for work, he kept receiving bad news, one after the other. The IT team informed him that several issues were plaguing the system – the execution of the automated regression pack couldn’t be completed within the stipulated time and a timely decision couldn’t be taken to provide sign-off on business scenarios. The automation regression suite comprised of 10,000 business scenarios to be validated for every week but with these problems, validation on time was becoming a problem.

Alex was aware that these problems would impact the end customers financially and also the credibility of the application. Also, the untested business scenarios would impact the business for the end users. The company couldn’t afford a business loss at such a stage and hence an immediate resolution was needed. He decided to hire a third-party vendor to get the work done and after going through several profiles, he decided to work with TCS, a consultancy that had proved its worth several times in the past. Alex arranged for a quick meeting with the TCS team and explained the problems and requirements. The TCS team agreed to work on the project and assigned the same to Mahadevan Mani, an experienced and talented TCS employee.



Mahadevan was selected since he had been working in the banking landscape for more than a decade and had in-depth knowledge of the applications. He quickly formed his team and analyzed the entire situation to figure out the cause of the delay. Post analysis, he proposed and implemented an AI-based auto decision making analysis utility of the automated scripts that would make failure-based decisions on certain rules that the system self-learned.

Post automation execution, the AI-based solution could pick up the failed scripts and perform the analysis. It could show the analysis report with failure categorization and also provide suggestions to fix the issues. Runtime logs were also captured during automation execution which could be used for analysis using NLP. Machine learning algorithms helped to categorize the automation failures based on the available training data set. Mahadevan integrated the acceptance and regression test with the AI code to determine the gating factor dynamically to stage build from lower test to the UAT environment. This supported the delivery of high-quality codes to the test teams that resulted in no production defect leakage for the last 3 consecutive releases.

Mahadevan’s AI solution helped to reduce more than 90 percent failure analysis effort, which was highly appreciated by Alex and the IT team.

"We’ve all had bad experiences with miscommunication in our day to day lives. This can often disrupt the flow of critical information which would result in a less than ideal situation. The same is also true for businesses. The internal functioning of an organization depends on the seamless and harmonious performance of multiple departments towards a single goal. A gap in communication between any department can often lead to chaos which can have an adverse impact on the business.

A leading bank operating in the Financial Services Domain was experiencing a similar situation. At this point, TCS had been working with the client in their large application operation program in the Asia Pacific and EMEA region. One of the primary Service Level Agreement (SLA) was to reduce the ticket volume. The Service Provider who was previously tasked with this project had left a hostile environment for TCS to take over. However, in a surprising turn of events, in less than 8 months, TCS noticed an increase in ticket flow from business users. In a bid to counter this trend, the client and TCS set out to ensure a 20% decrease in ticket flow in 2 months. The challenge was set. Failure to successfully achieve this target would result in TCS facing SLA penalties.

With no clarity on the reason for the sudden influx of ticket volume, TCS assigned Sunil Kini to the challenge. Tasked with the investigation and proposing solutions to tackle the current crisis, Sunil deep dived into the situation. Sunil came with over a decade of experience in working with the client. Combined with his contextual knowledge of the client’s processes, application landscape, and TCS and client connect, Sunil set about trying to establish the root cause for the problem.

Sunil analysed the data for the past 6 months to understand the trend of increased ticket inflow. He discovered that most of the issues were raised by the Business Users, of which, 80% of users were from TCS. Based on his investigation, Sunil suggested a ‘Stem the flow’ approach. This approach involved Sunil working from the Operation floor for 6 weeks to raise awareness and drive this solution. Sunil’s daily interaction with the team was used to create a Known Error Database (KEDB) which was updated in the client Wiki and could be referenced by all IT and Operations teams globally. This facilitated users to resolve their issue by executing the workaround scripts. In addition, a problem record was created and linked to each of these recurring issues for IT Support Teams to work on permanent fixes.

Sunil’s efforts helped bridge the gap between the IT and Operation Teams and streamline the issues coming from the floor thereby reducing ticket inflow. The process improvements provided enhanced inter-team coordination, issue handling process, communication and escalation channels.

The success of the ‘Stem the Flow’ saw a drastic reduction in ticket flow by 30% within the expected timeline. The client applauded Sunil and TCS for their persistent effort and accomplishment.",Stem The Flow Novel Approach Reduces Ticket Flow By 30,"M, Mr. KARTHEKEYAN (Karthekeyan)",Cards,Reporting,Cost & Optimization,Item,4
"When Asher joined as the business head of one of the largest North American financial services providers, he found that though the company had a strong customer base, it was yet to make an impression on the younger generation. And, this was only possible if they adapted to modern and customer-centric technologies. Asher discussed this plan with the management, which agreed that digital transformation was the only way to keep the company in competition with its contemporaries. The bank, therefore, embarked on a journey to transform its operations through technology and automation, and increase the speed to market by delivering in two-speed model.

The project was discussed with TCS, the bank’s strategic IT partner for 15 years. The TCS application teams were asked to create a scalable and high-performance application delivery team in support of the client’s commitment to agile, digital and dynamic development models. The IT giant accepted the challenge and Sabareesh was brought on-board.

Sabareesh had worked with the client for 14 years in various roles — developer, technical lead, subject matter expert and technical manager — and was well-versed with their business processes and IT landscape. He also used his technical expertise and domain knowledge of the banking and financial sector to spearhead this project.

Sabareesh quickly ramped up the TCS customer service application development team and aligned it as various scrum teams based on the business functions. He structured the roles of team members based on their agile and technical maturity. Sabareesh made them aware of modern technologies and trends, and motivated them to adopt these resources to innovate and improve productivity, quality and usability while reducing costs and risks. He also created internal study groups to encourage this team to upskill with NextGen Architecture, such as Cloud, MicroServices, Angular and DevOps, and evolve as full stack developers. TCS learning platforms, such as iEvolve and Fresco, played a big role in motivating the team members to learn new digital skills and adopt Agile way of working.

The client soon realized the benefits of Sabareesh’s relentless efforts. With the agile delivery model, the bank not only delivered new projects within a short span of time in an iterative fashion, but also the TCS team’s enhanced skills helped to modernize the customer service application and eliminate pain points of the legacy platform. This reflected in the company’s annual revenues and gave it the upper hand in the market.

Sabareesh quickly ramped up the TCS customer service application development team and aligned it as various scrum teams based on the business functions. He structured the roles of team members based on their agile and technical maturity. Sabareesh made them aware of modern technologies and trends, and motivated them to adopt these resources to innovate and improve productivity, quality and usability while reducing costs and risks. He also created internal study groups to encourage this team to upskill with NextGen Architecture, such as Cloud, MicroServices, Angular and DevOps, and evolve as full stack developers. TCS learning platforms, such as iEvolve and Fresco, played a big role in motivating the team members to learn new digital skills and adopt Agile way of working.

The client soon realized the benefits of Sabareesh’s relentless efforts. With the agile delivery model, the bank not only delivered new projects within a short span of time in an iterative fashion, but also the TCS team’s enhanced skills helped to modernize the customer service application and eliminate pain points of the legacy platform. This reflected in the company’s annual revenues and gave it the upper hand in the market.

Needless to say, Sabareesh received a lot of appreciation from the client and TCS management for the success of this project. It also enhanced TCS’s relationship with the client and led to more business engagements in the future.",Innovative It Solutions For Digital Transformation,Subramanian Balaguru,Cards,Agile Transformation,Growth & Transformation,Item,1
"When Asher joined as the business head of one of the largest North American financial services providers, he found that though the company had a strong customer base, it was yet to make an impression on the younger generation. And, this was only possible if they adapted to modern and customer-centric technologies. Asher discussed this plan with the management, which agreed that digital transformation was the only way to keep the company in competition with its contemporaries. The bank, therefore, embarked on a journey to transform its operations through technology and automation, and increase the speed to market by delivering in two-speed model.

The project was discussed with TCS, the bank’s strategic IT partner for 15 years. The TCS application teams were asked to create a scalable and high-performance application delivery team in support of the client’s commitment to agile, digital and dynamic development models. The IT giant accepted the challenge and Sabareesh was brought on-board.

"When a major deliverable with a short deadline arrived, Mahalakshmi was flabbergasted. She looked at the significant deliverable that had to be completed in 6 months without compromising the quality and looked very lost. Maha’s issues multiplied because of the high number of juniors in her team. She had to transform the client’s requirements into quality deliverables. Improving the productivity of each one was a big challenge. Any failure to overcome them would lead to effort and schedule slippage. That would impact the client in a major way as it was a mandated project for them.

The client solely depended on the TCS team and everyone being junior had very fair knowledge on delivering quality work items effectively. Maha was introduced to Senthil from TCS. He had a good experience with quality control tools like Sonarlint, SonarQube and CI and techniques and knowledge on TDD. That played a critical role in creating a solution for the client.

Senthil had back to back calls with the client reviewing and fixing bugs in between. Most of the bugs were quality related. It was realized that had they known how to handle them in advance, they could have had better productivity saving almost 2-3 hrs of each person's effort every day.

S Senthilmohan joined as a Project Lead (first time in his career). He interacted with the team members of the client and understood the needs and challenges in delivering good quality items. He needed to analyze the gap between the client’s expectation and the team’s understanding of it. First of all, he had to make the team understand what the actual problem was and the solution he was proposing had to be applied daily. By doing so, he gained the client’s confidence in the team.

Senthil configured the client’s version of the quality control tool and connected that to the server which had a number of rules to identify the bugs and quality of the code set in the server. This helped in highlighting the quality issues lively on the developer's machine. Before that, they had to complete the code and commit and wait for the CI tool to show the report on the items delivered. Also, Senthil trained the team to follow TDD(Test Driven Development). It meant that for any given requirement, they had to write the test case first, have it fail and fix it by writing the code for actual implementation (step by step).

This had saved a lot of effort of each team member. The client’s calls were also reduced as the deliverables turned into good quality items. The client wanted to apply this solution to other regions(Pune and U.S). Senthil was advised to share a document in configuring the quality tool on developers’ machines.

This solution led to the team (a Junior and himself) in acquiring the first two ranks in the Chennai region for having good productivity and delivering quality items in a year as measured by a third-party tool called Blue Optima (used by the client).

"When it came to aspects of adherence to Legal, Compliance and Regulatory standards especially on the software applications front, the actions needed to be swift to ensure the least damage to the client. The client was one of the biggest Credit Card issuers in the North America region. One of the divisions in the cards business was customer servicing and TCS was awarded this project from a technology standpoint.

More than the issue to do with compliance the client was facing the pace at which their applications were becoming compliant was a huge issue. The client had been subject to federal penalties due to these delays in the past and they wanted this to be eradicated forever.

One of the key reasons was because of the application’s development model which was based on the age-old waterfall model which had an average completion timeline of 6 to 9 months irrespective of the nature and size of the change new feature set, hence it was taking more time to deliver the changes and hence the penalties in the meantime, unfortunately.

It was the need of the hour for TCS to address as they risked losing the client to a competitor otherwise. Hence TCS formed the domain group with the intent of giving domain training to the associates. Purushotham Nagumalli the lead from TCS took up specific sessions on the cards business within this group. From Business perspective, this helped him to understand the impact of the changes needed. Working with the client for more than 6 years helped him understand the client work culture and processes. He was certified from Scrum.org & Scrum alliance.






It was a formidable challenge for Purushotham in migrating to an agile way of software development from a traditional waterfall model as there were a lot of operational changes required on a team level. There were concerns from team members on their roles and how the change will be delivered and received by the clients under the new agile approach. In order to alleviate the concerns, more discussions were conducted to explain Agile values and principles clearly. TCS Agile coach pitched in to get the initial guidance and to start with. By understanding the client’s culture helped the team in knowing the project delivery expectations and proceeded to work and deliver without any issues.

The client began to see the quality of the results delivered and now any ad hoc changes were being implemented in short turnaround times. The time spent on project initiations and initial discussions/meetings got reduced. The client stakeholders were very much satisfied with the delivery from TCS and this was evident from the fact that the reengineering of the project was awarded to TCS again. This reestablished the trust based on the technical expertise showcased and how the software development model transitioned and delivered from the traditional Waterfall to Agile methodology.

The transition was a huge success with the client as it reduced their operating costs due to time and resources saved. The client stakeholders were also happy with the way TCS ran the scrum teams and how the agile practices were implemented. The client was more than satisfied with the transformation progress and further engaged with TCS to make the agile transformation leap on other applications too",One Small Step Into Agile Sdlc Is One Giant Leap For The Clients Business,"MRJ, Mr. SABAREESH KUMAR (SABAREESH KUMAR)",Cards,Agile Transformation,Growth & Transformation,Item,1
"Will* was the Head of IT operations of a leading financial bank in the US and he was having a casual lunch meeting with Krish*, the account manager at TCS. Both the companies had been partnering for more than 15 years and during this time, TCS had delivered many software solutions and had also streamlined operations to help the client move forward with many strategies. TCS was seen as a trusted partner that could execute the client's ideas perfectly.

During the meeting, Will spoke about the need to reuse existing products to save time and effort. He said that the management was looking at different ways to boost productivity and reduce development cost, and this was one of the options that they were looking at. To this end, Will wanted the TCS team to take a look at different processes and change it in such a way that the same processes can be used across different tasks, with slight modifications in a table, when needed. Krish agreed to come up with a plan to reuse the existing processes to avoid duplication and assigned MohanaGanesan to it.

Mohan and his team had been working on many projects with the client and when Krish informed them of this project, they came up with a solution to reduce the recurring effort. Their solution was based on the concept of Component-Based Software Engineering (CBSE), a process that emphasizes the design and construction of computer-based systems using reusable components.






The team researched and analyzed all the similar projects implemented earlier and spent efforts in streamlining the same. Since Mohan had been with the client for many years, he had a complete understanding of the underlying systems and infrastructure. Using this knowledge, he came up with a customized standard process that could be adopted for all similar projects with just minor changes where required. The major parts of the process were untouched and any change required just simple changes such as a table update or a correction to a typo. The whole process was designed to be table-dependent and the process and the components remained the same for all the projects.

The client loved the solution and gave a green signal for its implementation. However, the implementation was fraught with many challenges such as getting a detailed list of components and processes followed by different timelines. With his contextual knowledge, Mohan was able to pull up a set of processes that were recurring with each project and was able to leverage these processes for all the projects.

The solution was implemented into production and could be invoked when needed. This resulted in a reduction of the effort spent on similar projects. The client was very happy and this reflected in the customer's appreciation messages. As a result of this implementation, the customer was able to take up new initiatives with the space available from the effort reduction on those projects.

"Wilson worked as the Mortgage Operations and technology manager of a bank with a global reputation for its services. The bank had US Retail and Mortgage LOB with various homegrown systems developed over a period of time with extensive interfacing. The Mortgage Transformation initiative allowed the bank to make the Operations team’s Servicing and Reporting cost-effective. The bank operations had 224 Business Managed Tools (BMTs) reporting from various applications and with a new vendor doing Servicing, these BMTs needed to be revamped and developed in Cognos tool. The Project required a thorough understanding of existing systems, database field mapping between the client and vendor application and current reports in the SSIS tool to write them under Cognos for a period of 3 years.

Branch Oversight tool (BOT) was used by Wilson’s Oversight department to record, analyze and reflect the risk and control operational health of the branch network. Project work resulted in 105 consolidated reports and allowed the bank to retire old reports. Cognos reports were fully automated with only 10% requiring input to generate reports.

BOT was becoming a risk to the bank due to SDLC issues and no source code management. EOVS was to cost an additional $45,000 from next year. Wilson wanted to automate and move to a proper support model. Various redundant processes were shut down and decommissioning of the banks systems were planned, as Operations no longer used them.

Wilson requested TCS to let Sandeep Jadhav who was associated with them for the last 11 years to lead this transformation project. Sandeep had worked as Developer, Vendor Applications, Business Analyst and Technical lead which allowed him better insight on the banks systems and their interfaces.



He set up a Mortgage transformation project team of 8 Cognos and SSIS developers to understand existing reports and create extensive mapping documents. Mapping document allowed the team to define how database fields translate existing client system data to the Vendor system (sending data to Data warehouse). BOT application support coming to TCS allowed technology alleviates a big risk of production outage and cost to the Oversight department.

Sandeep followed best practices to create mapping documents, find solutions on database fields still left with no mapping and consolidate the number of reports from 224 to 105. BOT application changes were planned with creation of ServiceNow change process setup, creation of Induction manual explaining how application works and required components.
Mortgage Operations team member efficiency increased due to automation of reports and they were able to focus on new reporting solutions. Wilson appreciated Sandeep’s leadership and guidance allowing TCS to set up a new project team to support ongoing optimization.

Sandeep received the Start of Quarter award for Mortgage transformation initiative.
Over a period of time, knowledge and understanding on the client’s project allowed TCS to make automation, safety and soundness and agile team setup.

"With The corona pandemic rapidly changing how companies operate across the US, many businesses have taken to email, social media and in-store signage to communicate clearly with customers about what they are doing to respond. Customers had to wait for assistance stretching to multiple hours and also the policies were changing day by day. Then came the concept of remote work. Data shows that employees' biggest complaint about remote work is about managers who lack respect for normal working hours.

The Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) outbreak since Jan 2020 created a critical and similar situation worldwide and a leading US automotive finance company needed to respond to this urgency. The Client leaders were looking for options like remote work to safeguard their employees and the workplace. This was a challenge given the legacy phone infrastructure that the customer service representatives were presently using across different US sites to support customer servicing.

Interactive Voice Response (IVR) is an important channel to resolve customer requests with self-service or routing them to qualified agents. The efficiency of the IVR solution increases customer experience and improves customer acquisition, retention and in turn impacts the brand value growth. Any disruptions in customer services can cause financial and brand damage. Therefore, to avoid such repercussions, it was essential for our client to devise a solution that would allow the agents to be able to support the call center remotely and handle around 30,000 calls per day given the workplace shutdown following the guidelines from government officials.


The client was looking forward to its partners for ongoing support and commitment to work through this difficult situation and short turnaround time. The solution would ensure that the client would be able to service customers calling into their IVR application and provide good customer service and experience. However, setting up infrastructure and software, configuring agents on the new platform, developing and testing the integrations in such a short time period were challenging. TCS, being the partner for this company was in search of a good team and assigned this challenging project to Amit Bhakat and his team.

Sketches were drawn by the team to migrate the agents in batches to a cloud contact center platform utilizing VoIP phones on a cloud-based contact center platform. The solution leveraged the existing IVR platform for self-service and routed customer calls to the agent’s VoIP phones. The challenge was to provide the data collected in the IVR system to the agent’s screen and CRM system for better caller experience. Amit and his team identified the critical data elements captured in the IVR system and devised a way to store them into a database and then retrieved them on the agent side using APIs. This provided seamless integration for callers and agent experience and shortened the call duration. The agents now had the capability to remote login using their laptops and use a VoIP phone to interact with the customer as compared to their traditional desk phones.

The client leaders were now able to fulfill their brand’s commitment to support the communities, local and national and avoid risking the health of the workforce. The design architecture of this integration was agile and could be adapted for additional TCS clients who are looking forward to migrating their contact center from one platform to another including cloud migrations without causing any major disruption in services or workforce management.

"With the swift technological advancement in the web-based technologies and the power of the internet devices, the banking industry was on a race with one another on who gets to woo the customer base with cutting edge application solutions. For this client, the NAM Third-Party Risk Management (TPRM) BAU activities were not fully automated.

It included manual processing of reviews and audits on spreadsheets and physical documents. The operations were obviously not efficient. Analysts were not able to complete audits and reviews effectively and it resulted in time delays due to the consolidation of all information for every 3rd Party relationship managed by the TPRM NAM business. Lack of workflow automation and queueing resulted in diverting valuable resource hours for fixing the gaps rather than proactively addressing the business activities.

The client’s specific TPRM team managed 4500 of 3rd Parties that provide services to their Global Consumer Banking vertical. CBORC NAM team supported TPRM NAM Business by managing the Operational Risk for all these 3rd parties to identify and mitigate the risk involved with the services provided to them. With approximately 4000 relationships to manage and multiple monitoring processes in place, the complexity of Third-Party Risk Management increased by manifold and this was needed to be managed efficiently and seamlessly.

Being the contextual master Pattamuthu Arumugam took the challenge head-on and decided to address the client’s needs by completely revamping the core technology. The legacy monolithic core application was upgraded into an Angular based front-end with microservices supporting from the backend. The existing application had a lot of dependencies, no standard screen designs for the application and the technology used in legacy applications were outdated and had no support.


Developing an application using new technologies (Angular, Nginx, and microservices) in Collections for the first time in the client environment was indeed a challenge. Pattamuthu and his team were the first ones to work on Collections to scale up, develop and deploy an application with these tech stacks.

With his technical expertise in JAVA/J2EE framework technologies, Pattamuthu delved into microservices, spring boot application development, and Angular package developments. He developed multiple custom Angular next-gen reusable packages not limited to Date, Custom predictable text box, page loading/progress bars that have been used across applications under the same business.
The initial rollout plan was for 5 releases, however, with the dedicated and sincere efforts of the team led by Pattamuthu, TCS delivered the same within 4 releases. The feedback received from the client stakeholders were extremely positive. The business users were ecstatic with the new screen designs, faster screen response time and having multiple controls on the page. This enabled TCS to get few additional application engagements from the client as well as another project on upgrading an application from Websphere to NGA architecture.",Upgrading Legacy Operations Into Digital Microservices,Subramanian Balaguru,Cards,Legacy Transformation,Growth & Transformation,Item,1
"Zach was the head of the Asset Servicing Operations team of a leading Investment Bank in North America. His team was responsible for coordinating dividend payments. At the beginning of May 2020, his team received multiple complaints from top tier platinum clients expressing their concerns about the firm’s inability to pay dividend principal and interest correctly and consistently over the past few months. In addition to the financial impact of ~10.6 Million USD, this issue also had a negative reputational/relationship impact on the firm.

In the beginning, Zach’s team started applying manual payment adjustments to the customers to address the issue right away. However, when the volume kept increasing, they were unable to handle it manually, and that’s when Zach decided to reach out to TCS’s IT support team for help. Zach wanted to understand what went wrong with those payments and how it could be corrected going forward.



Being the primary support lead for the Asset Servicing IT team, Divya Deenadayalan started looking into this issue. Divya’s eight years’ experience working with this client had given her comprehensive knowledge about the functionality of the existing system. Her ability to propose effective solutions factoring in all the possible implications on individuals and organizations was an asset for the client.

She began her investigation by reviewing the 53 dividend events that were reported to have paid out incorrectly. Pretty soon, she was able to narrow down the root cause, that those events had derived incorrect coupon rates from an external system, leading to incorrect payments to customers. In the next few minutes, she facilitated a call with all the required stakeholders including the external system, development team, and business users. In the course of the call, the external system identified the bug in their process, which was sourcing incorrect coupon rates and feeding to downstream systems.

Though the fix was identified, the external system required two weeks to implement the same in production which would have kept the issue open until May end. However, business users didn’t want any payments to go wrong in the May month considering the deep concerns from platinum customers and the dire need of the hour was to figure out a way to handle/correct the impacted events before their May pay dates. When there was no systemic solution available, using her contextual knowledge, Divya proactively extracted the records that were due for May payments and built up a process within a short span using her superior analytical skills and technical expertise in Mainframe JCL’s.

Her tool helped in capturing the impacted events that had sourced incorrect rates from the external system. For business users to validate the events with ease, they were looking for factor information to be included to impact the analysis sheet. This being a challenging first-time request, Divya reverse-engineered the flow and derived the correct factor rates. She also collaborated with the development team to ensure there was a ‘four-eyes’ check on the data shared with the Operations team. She also proposed a workaround that the Operations team readily accepted and made the required amendments via Dividends Online screen which temporarily rectified the issue for the May payments.

She took it as her responsibility to cover this issue from all aspects including setting up monitoring in place for the impacted events on their pay dates and sharing daily updates with the business users until the permanent fix was implemented by the external system. In the end, the platinum customers were elated with the outcome, and the Operations team was relieved that the application was able to regain their trust. Zach and his team thanked TCS for their timely support. Divya received accolades from her Client Managers for the same.",Implementation Of An Indigenous Application To Streamline Payment Processing For A Leading Bank,SHAROAN Mohammed,Investment Banking,OpEx,Cost & Optimization,Item,1
"n 2017, when a large American financial provider launched its ambitious physical to cloud migration initiatives, the company’s IT chief James was asked to spearhead the first phase of this project. But unfortunately, it didn’t go well and the project became DIP-RED status. The management was upset and blamed James for it. A year later when the second phase of the migration had to be launched, James suggested that the bank should bring subject experts on board.

As TCS was already part of one of the company’s critical projects, it was asked to lead the second phase of cloud-migration as well. There were two challenges involved—bring the project on-track to fit the growth curve; and mitigate end of vendor support (EOVS)-end of life (EOL) and CAMP items for all physical servers without affecting regular development deliverables. Syed’s vast experience in cloud migration projects and association with the client made him the natural choice for this assignment.


The client’s prime concern was that they had to deliver regular projects while shutting down old environments and parallelly migrate to cloud. Approximately 30,000 business users were expected to be affected when vendors would shut down old servers post EOVS-EOL. TCS, being a core development vendor for the client, proposed to build an infrastructure team that will include development and infrastructure management experts. This team would help TCS developers on regular developments and also work closely with other vendors on cloud migration.

Syed’s prior knowledge and experience in FE-TIBCO-DB servers and their operations proved to be a boon for the client. He worked closely with DevOps-ProdOps to develop each cloud environment, guided them on configuration activities and monitored regular progress on development activities. Syed also took the initiative of conducting daily meetings with infra members to mitigate immediate issues in the project. All was well until the DevOps-ProdOps team structure changed during cloud migration. But Syed did not lose focus and successfully completed the project in September 2019. This program helped the company make savings of about USD 3.4 million in a year.

The client was highly impressed with Syed’s efficiency and dedication. He and his team worked more than 12 to 15 hours every day for almost 10 months. Syed planned activities well in advance to make Live on weekly-basis. This resulted in smooth product deliveries, the cloud migration project was marked GREEN and fit the client’s growth curve on this project. The company was contemplating of using this concept in other line of businesses as well. This also helped to strengthen TCS’s position within the organization.",Cloud Migration Solution For Applications Management,SHAROAN Mohammed,Retail Banking,Legacy Transformation,Cost & Optimization,Item,1
"‘It is not so easy to run a financial organization’- thought Kevin, while sipping on his favorite raspberry drink.For the world’s largest US-based finance company operating in 30+ countries, it is critical to keep up the standard at all times to retain its customer base. Heading the financial department, challenges were not new to Kevin, and he made sure to deploy the best of breed solutions for successful processes. This client has been known for providing financing, leasing and warranty services to consumers through participating automobile dealers in the United States. The company also manages a savings bank to offer a portfolio of banking and lending services exclusively for dealers. However, with direct lenders entering the auto finance industry, the company was facing challenges in maintaining growth through new consumer acquisitions.

There were various issues Kevin discussed in a recent meeting with the team. The company used a legacy loan origination system, which included manual underwriting and application processing. This system could not provide visibility into the loan application workflow. The company’s sales department was not able to extract critical information about loan applications. Payments, taxes, fees and insurance processing activities were performed by various groups that lacked coordination and information sharing. The mentioned problems were leading to operational inefficiency. With no further thoughts, Kevin approached their long-term strategic partner, TCS, to analyze the situation and propose a favorable way out of stagnancy. Satyaki Bhattacharyya, who has been associated with the client for over a decade, was the key consultant to support this program from offshore.

Satyaki has been an SME in the Auto Finance domain, having worked his way through loan originations, loan servicing and maintenance, closure/end-of-term and recovery processes and also in the asset-backed securitization process. He had earlier played the role of a consultant in the client's major transformation program, to design the asset-backed securitization process from scratch. It was a critical program visible and monitored at the CXO level, which made him gain extensive contextual knowledge on the major Auto-Finance Domain components.

Satyaki proposed a COTS-based solution to replace the legacy origination system; a step-by-step retiring plan and an imaging system was proposed to be implemented to scan all supporting documents. The images could be scanned either at a branch or sent to central operations to be scanned and saved in the ECM system. The credit analyst team used the work queues within the new loan origination COTS product, instead of manually sorting through applications before sending to loan officers for approvals. Exception reporting identified the most frequently occurring defects and a custom dashboard was also prepared to provide a single view of information in real-time for teams involved in loan processing. Visibility into deals and their respective age allowed for effective prioritization and distribution of work. This allowed continuous improvement in the process flow to enhance cycle times and SLA performance as well.

The key benefit of the new automatic loan origination system was having a significantly faster turnaround time for loan decisions. First decision time on loan applications were reduced by 40% and the final decision time by 70%. It also provided for a single integrated process and data capture, storage and retrieval of supporting documents along with reduced numbers, and frequency of exceptions in loan processing time. Kevin and his team praised the significant contribution of Satyaki in the overall execution.",A Comprehensive Solution Implemented Using Agile That Brought Down Loan Application Decision Time By 70 Percent,SENTHILNATHAN K.S,Commercial Banking,Agile Transformation,Growth & Transformation,Item,1
